Heretic Legion
shroud of darkness blankets the world.
Smoke and brimstone spews from the
yawning gates of Inferno, enveloping the
lands where people have abandoned God
and openly wage war against His Creation.
It is a grim reality that a full third of humanity has bent
its knee before the idols of Hell. The main military force
of Satan on Earth is the Heretic Legions, raised from
amongst these citizens of the damned.
Under special absolution from the Cardinal Protector,
many spies have been dispatched into Hell’s domains
over the years. Most are caught, never to be seen again,
save for some whose eternally screaming heads are
returned to New Antioch, branded with bleeding runes
that mock the Holy Trinity.
Against all odds some do make it back to the light,
whispering of the horrors they have witnessed: of
firstborn cast into the mouths of the burning statues
of Baal and human flesh sold by the pound in dreadful
markets. They speak of the great idols of the Golden
Calf and rapturous men and women who prostrate
themselves before them, carving off strips of their own
flesh in ecstatic offering. Inverted pyramids and towers
descend into the depths of these cities, built of iron and
black stone. Within these pits stand sacrificial altars
where weeping captives are slowly sliced to death over
agonising days and weeks with wicked knives made of
infernal basalt. Cathedrals dedicated to the Princes of
Hell hang from great arches of volcanic stone, while
condemned are crucified on hundreds of upside-down
crosses.
Accounts speak of sprawling factories made of
mutilated flesh and metal, their forges yielding endless
munitions for the ongoing war. Guided by the teachings
of Tartarus’ smiths, alchemists toil over colossal weapons
and armoured behemoths, wielding the forbidden
secrets of their patrons’ metallurgy to forge instruments
of death and suffering beyond the grasp of any human
engineer. These are once-proud cities of Earth, where
churches have been toppled and entire populations are
now dedicated towards bringing down the very Throne
“We are no longer supplicating
weaklings trembling before an
unmerciful God. We say: Blessed
are the mighty-minded, for they
shall ride the whirlwinds.”
- Ramman, Anointed of the XXI
  Heretic Legion ‘Widowmakers’
  of Heaven.
  Amongst the forsaken citizens enduring within Hell’s
  earthly domains, the greatest status is afforded to those
  who fight in the Great War. Most do this as Heretic
  Troopers who serve their liege lords in lieu of tribute. To
  join the army of damnation as a full-fledged Legionnaire
  is no easy feat. Those who wish to win a place amongst
  the Heretic Legions must make an unholy pilgrimage
  to the burning bronze gates of Hell where the infernal
  heat, felt from leagues away, sears both flesh and spirit
  until the torment becomes unbearable. Along the Valley
  of Tears, the great road that leads to the gate is paved
  with wailing souls and lamentations and littered with
  endless mounds of charred bodies. Many are still halfalive, writhing in agony, trapped in a grotesque twilight
  between life and death, their wickedness deemed
  insufficient. These discarded souls are doomed to suffer
  until the Day of Judgement.
  Those who make it within sight of Hell’s Maw are
  considered worthy and are initiated into the Legions,
  taking unbreakable vows that chain them into darkness
  for all eternity, their bodies branded with the mark of
  the Devil Lord that has claimed them. Armouries of
  Hell equip them for battle and Heretic Priests beckon
  forth new supplicants as dictated by the whispers of their
  patron Archdevils. Thus a new Heretic Legionnaire is
  born. They hail Archdevils as their masters and are thus
  damned for all eternity.
  There are some who push further on, to the Gate itself
  and beyond. Their very flesh ignites, never to recover,
  but those with the blackest souls can enter Inferno
  itself. Amongst those the Anointed are especially
  revered amongst the Legions. They are the paragons of
  unhinged brutality – men and women of colossal vigour
  and unyielding devotion. Having tread the accursed
  path to the shores of the Lake of Eternal Flame, where
  the damned wither and contort in ceaseless torment,
  the Anointed emerge forever scarred by the embrace
  of abyssal fires. The blackened and burnt flesh of the
  Anointed will never heal, but in exchange they are
  granted the right to wear Heavy Gehenna armoured

  suits and they gain strength to wield weapons that a
  normal man could barely lift. It is said that to gaze into
  their eyes is to glimpse the flames of Hell, forever etched
  in their vision.
  Yet some who witness go even further in their
  depraved devotion. Suicide is a mortal sin and one
  eagerly embraced by many. Most cry out for devils to
  notice their final sacrifice in vain, as the Infernal nobles
  are capricious and delight in betraying their own as
  much as their enemies. But those with truly wicked
  and depraved souls are resurrected in contempt of the
  Redeemer, coming back as Choristers, horrific mockeries
  of Creation whose severed heads sing unholy hymns
  praising the Devil, their voices causing the ears of their
  enemies to bleed.
  Though the vast bulk of the Heretic Legions are made
  of mortal humans, Hell often sends their own abhorrent
  progeny to reinforce their mortal foot soldiers:
  nightmarish War Beasts made of captured and possessed
  creatures and dreaded Artillery Witches who act as
  mobile artillery supporting lighting assaults. Thus, in
  this accursed theatre of war, mortals and abominations
  march hand in withering hand, bound by the suffering
  ties of damnation. The wails of tortured beasts meld
  with the shrieks of damned souls, while the skies rain
  down fiery retribution upon all who dare to oppose the
  Heretics’ ceaseless crusade for a demented parity with
  their Creator.

  Heretic Special Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Heretic Warband.
  Sacrificial Knife
  Terrifying blades blessed by the hand of a greater devil, these knives are used in Heretic rituals to sacrifice captives to the
  dark powers of Hell. They simply need to touch their opponents to cause indescribable pain and even the slightest wound
  often proves fatal. They are risky even to their wielders, as the merest scratch wounds friend and a foe alike.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Sacrificial Knife 1-handed Melee +2 on injury results RISKY
  Rules: The Sacrificial Knife adds +2 to all rolls on the Injury Chart. For example, a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart
  becomes 9 when using the Sacrificial Knife.
  Blasphemous Staff
  Made in mockery of the rod carried by the Prophet Aaron, the slightest touch from this evil staff causes unimaginable
  agony.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Blasphemous Staff 1-handed Melee - FIRE, CRITICAL
  Rules: Gives +1 DICE bonus to any other ACTION the model takes apart from Dash, Ranged Attack or Melee

  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Hellblade 2-handed Melee +1D to Injuries FIRE
  Rules: The Hellblade has +1 DICE when rolling for injuries. It also has the Keyword FIRE, so it causes an
  additional +1 BLOOD MARKER on enemies it hits.
  Tartarus Claws
  Made from the severed hands of Malebranche, Tartarus Claws are granted by Arch-Devils only to those whose hearts are
  blackened with the sin of wrath.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Tartarus Claws 2-handed Melee - CUMBERSOME
  Rules: Tartarus Claws always come as a pair and do not allow the use of any other melee weapons or shield. You
  can make two Attack ACTIONS with the Claws without the usual -1 DICE for the second attack. If the opponent
  is taken Down or Out of Action with either of the Claws you may immediately move the model up to 6” in any
  direction. If the move takes you into contact with another enemy model, this counts as a charge and you can make a
  second Melee Attack ACTION with both claws. You can only do this follow-up move once per Activation.

  The Leader of a Heretic warband. These fallen priests perform all kinds of unholy magics,
  summoning petrifying demons and creatures using their Goetic spells. Often pledged to a
  Demon Lord in Hell, such as Pazuzu or Guison, the Profane Gospels they recite terrify
  church forces, causing ears to bleed and eyeballs to burst in their sockets.

  Silenced Pistols, a Tormentor Chain and Gas Grenades.
  Abilities
  ; Infiltrator: The Death Commando can be placed anywhere on the table out of
  line of sight of any enemies, but at least 8” away from the closest enemy. Deployed
  after all other models without the Keyword INFILTRATOR.
  ; Stealth Generator: Ranged attacks against a Death Commando suffer -1 DICE
  to all the attack rolls.
  ; Hide: As a RISKY ACTION with +1 DICE the Commando can hide if any
  piece of scenery the model is touching can block line of sight in any direction, even
  partially, regardless of whether an enemy currently has a clear LOS. If successful,
  enemies cannot target the Commando with ranged attacks or Charges. Weapons
  with the Keyword BLAST affect the Commando as normal if it is in the radius of the

  it makes a Ranged Attack or an enemy model comes within 1.5” of it.

  0-1 Heretic Chorister (Cost: 65 Ducats)
  Suicide is a Mortal Sin, and sacrificing yourself to the glory of Hell is a yet greater affront
  to God. Some Heretics born with a gift of sonorous voice but little prospects of rising
  through the ranks but possessing a determination to excel may pursue the dark path of
  becoming a Chorister.
  Such supplicants go to one of the black altars of Heretic abodes at the bottom of the deep
  inverted pyramid temples dedicated to the greatest of Arch-devils. There they are dressed
  in the robes of dark devotion, lie on the altar and mutilate themselves to death by
  carving unholy runes into their flesh. The more wounds they can suffer before perishing,
  the more pleasing it is said their offering is. The most devout slice their own throats,
  trying to cut as deep as they can before their miserable life leaves them.
  Most such wretches go to their doom in the Lake of Fire, but some are reborn as
  Choristers after nine days. Their corpses lurch back to their feet, and finish their grisly
  beheading, and lift their severed heads that begin to sing hymns they have learned in the
  Inferno. From their self-inflicted wounds spurts cold blood that forms diabolic symbols
  and changes to match the words of their unholy chorale. They head towards the front
  lines driven by a call no living can hear and join the Heretic warband of their choosing.
  As their severed heads sing their agonising hymns, the minds of their enemies are filled
  with visions from the Pits of Hell, weakening both the resolve and strength of those
  unfortunate enough to hear the dire song of a Chorister. Their hymns are often the first
  thing a fresh recruit experiences on the battlefield, as their unholy voice rolls across the
  trenches, proclaiming a never-ending prophecy of the final victory of Hell over Heaven.

  This abomination charges through miles of barbed wire to clear a path for the heretic

  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base

  Equipment
  You cannot buy additional equipment, weapons or armour for War Wolves. Each
  War Wolf is encased in a nigh impregnable suit of Tartarus Armour that is reflected
  in its profile above. Additionally, each War Wolf has a set of Shredding Claws and a
  vicious Chainsaw Mouth. These pieces of equipment are built into the integrity of
  its construction and cannot be removed or lost in any way. The weapons are detailed
  below. The War Wolf may make one attack ACTION with each of these weapons in
  Melee Combat and may make no other attacks during its Activation (so it can make
  two attacks per Activation).
  ; Chainmaw: The War Wolf treats its Chainsaw Mouth as a melee weapon with
  the Keyword RISKY that grants a +1 DICE bonus to hit (for total of +3D).
  Additionally, the attack ignores any armour worn by the target and has a +1 DICE
  bonus to injure. The Chainsaw Mouth does not take any hands to wield.
  ; Shredding Claws: The War Wolf treats its Shredding Claws as a two-handed
  melee weapon with the Keywords RISKY and CUMBERSOME. The Shredding
  Claws have a +1 DICE bonus to injure. Because the Shredding Claws are wielded
  alongside the Chainsaw Mouth, they are treated as an Off-Hand Weapon and
  suffer penalties accordingly.
  Abilities
  ; Tough: War Wolves are huge
  creatures with unnatural vitality

  0-1 Artillery Witches (Cost: 90 Ducats)
  (You may include 0-2 Artillery Witches in a warband worth more than 1000 ducats)
  Artillery Witches stalk the battlefields, hurling ordnance assembled in the death factories
  of Hell’s Third Circle. They are completely mute and no one has ever seen their faces. Some
  question if they are even living, and there are tales that they too were manufactured in
  Hell. They can pull an infinite number of Infernal Bombs from a portal to Hell that they
  manifest at will, summoning them to their hands from a gate of midnight blackness.
  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base
  Artillery Witch 6”/Infantry 0 Dice -1 Dice 0 25mm
  Equipment
  An Artillery Witch is always equipped with an endless supply of Infernal Bombs (see
  below) and can carry no other ranged weapons. Otherwise, she can be equipped with
  any melee weapon, armour or equipment from the Heretic Legion Armoury.
  Abilities
  ; Infernal Bomb: This wicked infernal weapon is treated as a one-handed
  Ranged weapon with the Keyword BLAST 3”. Specify a 1x1mm point on the
  battlefield within 36” that the Witch can see and that you want to target. Next,
  make a Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less with the two
  lowest Dice), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location, multiplied by the
  number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bomb
  lands 2” away, as 7 - 5 = 2). The direction is decided by your opponent. Roll on the
  Injury Chart for each model within the BLAST radius.
  If the bomb lands exactly on top of any model, roll with 3D6 on the Injury Chart
  and add the dice together! Other models hit by the bomb roll on the Injury Chart
  as standard. Any model hit, but not taken Out of Action, by this attack is blown
  D3” directly away from the point of impact (roll for each model separately),
  stopping if they hit other models, buildings or objects. This attack has the Keyword
  SHRAPNEL and therefore causes an additional +1 BLOOD MARKER. Cover, range
  and higher position do not affect attacks by the Infernal Bomb. Roll injuries for
  models that would benefit from Cover from the perspective of the BLAST point
  with -1 DICE. The Activation of the Witch ends immediately after using the
  Infernal Bomb.
  ; Artificial Life: Artillery Witches are not affected by FEAR. Additionally,
  attacks with the Keyword GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure the Witch and
  they do not suffer additional BLOOD MARKERS from the Keyword GAS.
  ; Levitate: The Artillery Witch can Climb up without taking
  an ACTION and does not roll on the Injury Chart
  when falling.

  Wretched (Cost: 25 Ducats)
  (Your warband may include any number of Wretched as long as they are outnumbered
  by models with the Keyword HERETIC.)
  Many unfortunates fall into the hands of the Heretic warbands, either during one of their
  many raids or battles, or purchased from the slave markets within their own territories.
  Some are foolhardy adventurers who travel into the domains of the damned only to be
  caught by their watchful patrols.
  Their lot is grim and terrible. They are worked to death in the factories of Sixty-Six Lords,
  butchered for meat, or worst of all, sold or offered to the agents of the Court of the SevenHeaded Serpent to be used as raw power for Goetic Spells.
  Yet one path to freedom exists: they can volunteer to serve in the Legions as the lowest of
  low, the most disposable of penal troops. For the law of Hell is clear: those who rebel against
  God can gain their freedom if they are deemed to have performed sufficiently great deeds.
  Thus it is no wonder that many Heretic warbands drive swarms of the Wretched ahead of
  them to blunt and slow down the enemy assaults.
  Wretched are branded with cursed flesh-eating tattoos as a safeguard against escape and
  heavily drugged to degrade and dull their will, while still leaving their aggression intact.
  Heretic Elites discard the lives of the Wretched carelessly, as their sacrifice on the battlefield
  counts as a worthy deed which will be rewarded by their Patrons.
  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base
  Wretched 6”/Infantry -1 Dice -1 Dice 0 25mm
  Equipment
  The Wretched can be equipped with any melee weapon, armour or equipment from
  the Heretic Armoury List. None of their weapons, armour or equipment can cost more
  than 10 ducats each. Every Wretched must be equipped with at least one weapon.
  Abilities
  ; Law of Hell: If a Wretch manages to take any enemy ELITE model Out of
  Action or performs a Glorious Deed, it gains its freedom and is immediately
  removed from the battle and from your warband permanently. It does not count
  as a casualty, but your warband’s total size for this battle is reduced by one for
  purposes of Morale.
  ; Dark Blessing: If a Wretch is taken Out of Action in battle, one of
  your models with Keywords HERETIC and ELITE gains one BLESSING
  MARKER.
  ; Chattel: Wretched can be sold at any time for their full ducat value between
  battles. Note that their weapons, armour and equipment still only fetch half price.

Warband Variant: Heretic
Naval Raiding Party
The Heretic Fleet operates as a semi-autonomous entity
under the command of its High Captain and other
admirals. The Heretics have their own marine infantry
that often operates in small bands, striking deep behind
enemy lines and executing smash and grab missions.
They are always on the lookout for captives, loot,
information, supplies, rare artefacts and any opportunity
to express their cruelty and brutality. They are picked
from amongst the best soldiers of the Heretic Legions,
and have access to equipment and weapons gained from
past battles and terrible atrocities they have committed.
Special rules
The Heretic Naval Raiding Party has the following
special rules:
; Fast as Lightning: All Models have +1 DICE
when taking their Dash ACTIONS.
; Close Assault Weapons: The warband can buy
Submachine Guns for 25 ducats per weapon.
; Light Troops: The force may only include 0-1
Annointed and 0-1 Artillery Witch.
; Let Sleeping Dogs Lie: The warband may not
include a War Wolf.
; Unseen Advance: Up to three models
without ELITE Keyword can be upgraded into
INFILTRATORS at the cost of 10 ducats per Model.
Warband Variant:
Trench Ghosts
Sometimes when Heretic troopers die upon a hallowed
ground or in presence of an uncorrupted holy relic, they
become trapped between planes of existence. Claimed
by neither Heaven nor Hell, the Trench Ghosts become
Undead – doomed to fight a war without an end,
attacking both the Faithful and Heretic alike, hating all
life, obeying commands that no living can hear. Their
greed for worldly wealth and items of power remains
undiminished, and their semi-corporeal bodies are
exceedingly difficult to destroy. Their faces, covered
with gas masks they no longer have any use for, betray
nothing of the agony they endure. In close combat they
whisper of the agony of their existence and the pain of
their doom which will never give them rest, their broken
bodies and shattered minds forced to endure the horrors
of war for all eternity. Few can withstand such terror
without breaking.
Tales are told of many Trench Ghost Warbands that
haunt No Man’s Land, but the most famous are the
Ghosts of Tannenberg, shades of the Heretic force that
won the battle of Tannenberg but after sacking the
Church of St. Jacob passed into the shadow.
Special rules
The Trench Ghosts have the following special rules:
; Horror: All models in the Warband cause FEAR.
; Semi-corporeal: Any Ranged attacks against all
models in the Trench Ghost Warband roll injuries
with -1 DICE – the undead are hard to kill with
bullets! Melee Attacks do not suffer this penalty.
; Spectral: All models in the warband ignore
movement penalties caused by Difficult Terrain,
though they cannot move through any objects/
terrain. Dangerous terrain affects them as normal.
; Undead: All models in the Trench Ghost
warband do not suffer additional BLOOD MARKERS
from attacks with the Keyword GAS.
; Enemies of All: Trench Ghosts cannot use
Mercenaries.
; Lost Souls: Since only mortals who have souls
become ghosts, this warband may not have any
model with the Keyword ARTIFICIAL, such as
War Wolves or Artillery Witches. In addition, no
model in the warband may have a Hellbound Soul
Contract or an Infernal Brand Mark. Any model
that has one of these pieces of equipment in their
base profile will not have it, although its price stays
the same.
; Slow: All models in Trench Ghost warband have
a half Dash distance (i.e. 3”), and they suffer -1
DICE to all attacks against models Retreating from

Melee combat.
; Sarcophagus Mine: At the cost of +30
ducats, up to two of the Troopers can be turned
into Sarcophagus Mines. They gain an armour
characteristic of -3, but can carry no other weapons
or any other items from the Armoury. In addition,
whenever an enemy comes within 3” of the Mine,
you can trigger a detonation as described below.
Alternatively, you can forgo this and explode the
mine during your own Activation of the model with
a successful RISKY ACTION with +1 DICE.
; When detonated, the mine explosion
is treated as a BLAST 3” weapon targeting
the Sarcophagus model with Keyword
SHRAPNEL. Models within 1” of the model
hit by the explosion roll their injuries with +1
DICE. The Mine itself is taken Out of Action.
; Barbed Wire Banshee: Instead of a Chorister,
a Trench Ghost warband may include a Barbed
Wire Banshee at the same cost. It has the same
characteristics as a Chorister with the usual Trench
Ghost special rules applied to it, but instead of the
Unholy Hymns ability the Banshee has Death Wail
as detailed below:
; Death Wail: All enemy models within 8”
of the Chorister suffer an additional +1 DICE
when any injury roll is made against them.
; Tank Palanquin: At the cost of 60 ducats, the
Heretic Priest of the warband can ride a ghostly
Tank Palanquin. This counts as Machine Armour
and the Priest riding it has a 50mm base, and counts
as being on a 2” high platform. While on a Tank
Palanquin, the Priest gains the Keyword STRONG.

Warband Variant:
Knights of Avarice
The warbands who follow the Prince of Greed call
themselves the Knights of Avarice. Such heretics display
their wealth extravagantly and prefer to carry the most
expensive and hard-to-acquire weapons, armour and
equipment, suffering none to join them who lacks
the means to obtain their glittering panoply. They are
festooned with chains of gold and the finest silk cloaks,
their armour is gilded with gold and decorated with
precious stones, and the handles of their great coin
hammers are made of the rarest of wood. Yet despite
the opulent wealth at display, their finery is tarnished
by the blood and soot that spews from the Hellgate,
and the delicate artistic filigree of their golden masks is
both terrible and beautiful in equal measure. In combat
they favour hammers and clubs that break the bones but
leave the flesh and blood intact, as well as poison gas and
highly accurate rifles. They scorn crude and destructive
fire or explosive weapons that could damage any objects
of value.
After the Knights of Avarice have claimed victory in
combat, they scour the battlefield or any settlement
they’ve conquered like a swarm of locusts. Anything and
everything of value is taken: metals from brass to bronze,
silver to gold, art objects, precious stones, livestock,
trade goods, rare tomes and scrolls… all are meticulously
catalogued and carried away by slaves and demonic
beasts of burden or great armoured cars that take the
stolen loot to the underground treasure chambers
which act as the temples of Mammon. Even the dead
are stripped of their flesh with the detached skill of
seasoned butchers, ready to be sold at market. Internal
organs taken from fallen victims are carefully preserved
in alchemical liquids to be sold to the scientists of the
infernal laboratories.
For the Heretics of the Path of Mammon hoarding
riches is not mere acquisition of wealth – it is their
religious compulsion. Ironically, they gain little
pleasure from their vast wealth, as their greed makes
them continuously desire ever greater riches. Thus
their warbands forever roam No Man’s Land, looking
for forgotten treasures or foes to dissect and turn into
wealth. For the greed of Mammon will never be sated.
Special rules
The Knights of Avarice have the following special rules:
; Worship Mammon: In a campaign, the patron
of the warband will always be Mammon. Instead of
the Puppet Master ability, the Heretic Priest of the
Knights of Avarice may select the Price of Greed
ability if they wish:
The Price of Greed: Worldly wealth belonging to the
target model of this curse starts crushing them under
its weight. Choose any model the Priest sees within
12” and take a RISKY ACTION. If successful, roll
immediately on the Injury Chart for that model and
add +1 DICE to the injury roll for each -1 Armour
modifier the model has (for example if the model
has a Trench Shield and standard armour, add +2
DICE to the injury rolls).
; Mammon’s Chosen: Knights of Avarice
allow only the wealthiest and the best-equipped
candidates to join their ranks. Your force may have
no models that cost less than 80 ducats (including
their equipment).
; Corrupt Merchants: Many merchants, traders
and moneylenders within the Faithful nations
are followers of Mammon and secretly supply the
Knights of Avarice with their wares. When creating
the warband, select one weapon, suit of armour or
other piece of equipment from the New Antioch
Armoury and one such item from the Iron Sultanate
Armoury. You can acquire this gear exactly as
the warband they come from. Any of these items
in question must not be already available to the
Heretic Warband. All the same limitations of the
original lists apply, so there is little point in taking an
Assassin’s Dagger (for example) since it can be only
used by Assassins. These two selected additions are
available to your warband throughout the campaign.
; Preserve the Loot: Knights of Avarice greatly
dislike using weapons that could damage the amount
of wealth that can be extracted from the fallen. No
weapon with the Keyword FIRE or SHRAPNEL can
be used by any model in this warband. In addition,
the Artillery Witches of this warband use Gas
Bombs: They have the Keyword GAS instead of
SHRAPNEL and they ignore armour. Injuries caused
by a direct hit are rolled with 2D6 and models
within a 3” blast radius are rolled with -1 DICE.
In a similar vein, their Grenade Launchers have the
GAS keyword instead of the SHRAPNEL keyword,
have a -1 D to injury rolls and ignore armour.
; Infernal Rivalry: Mammon is a rival of Beruth,
the great devil of wrath and murder, who is the
Patron of Death Commandos. Knights of Avarice
may include no Death Commandos.
; Goetic Warlocks: Goetic Warlocks are creations
of Mammon. This warband may include one for the
price of 110 ducats. This Warlock is still a mercenary
and obeys all of the rules associated with being a
mercenary (such as having fixed equipment and not
being able to be promoted to an ELITE throughout
the course of a campaign).
; Debtors to Mammon: Wretched of the warband
are not tied by Mammon’s Chosen rule.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Special Weapons & Equipment
Tarnished Armour 45 ducats
This suit of armour gilded with gleaming gold comes with a helmet often with a beautiful, cherub-like face warped or
corrupted in some way, such as with inhuman eyes or with the whole face twisted upside-down. Despite its splendour the
armour is always tarnished by blood, offal or other kind of corruption. Merely seeing it fills mortals with incredible greed
and makes the wearer an immediate target of their wrath as they attempt to tear it from them.
Rules: The suit counts as Reinforced Armour, a helmet and a gas mask. When an enemy declares a charge, they must
charge the model wearing this armour if it is visible, not in cover and within 12” of the wearer. The charging model
must be able to reach this model without climbing, leaping or crossing dangerous terrain. If the wearer of the armour
is already in melee combat, this power has no effect. LIMIT:1
Standard of Mammon 25 ducats
Battle Standards of Mammon are opulently decorated works of art, icons and banners done in mockery of the virtues
of Charity and Temperance. Always made of the most expensive materials, each is a unique work of dark genius, often
depicting saints performing vile sins or famous acts of Greed. It has the power to make anyone kneel before the Prince of
Greed.
Rules: Grants +1 DICE for all Morale tests as long as the model with the Flag is not Down or Out of Action.
Requires one hand to use as if it was a weapon, both in ranged and melee combat. Any enemy entering melee combat
with the model carrying this banner must make a successful ACTION or the model goes Down and cannot get up as
long as they are in melee combat with the bearer of the standard. LIMIT:1
Golden Calf Altar 20 ducats
This portable altar of Mammon creates illusions of immense wealth in any form its target covets above all. Overcome by
supernatural greed, those affected by the Curse of Mammon are forced to swoop down, feebly trying to pick up the objects of
their desire.
Rules: The area within 3” of the altar is Difficult Terrain for all models in the opposing Warband. This affects even
models that can Fly. The model carrying the altar may drop it at any point during their Activation. Once placed
down, the Golden Calf Altar cannot be picked up again. It has a 25mm base. HEAVY, CONSUMABLE, LIMIT:3
Coin Hammer 20 ducats
This double-handed hammer has the rune of mammon on its head. Its strikes leave a permanent, painful scar in the shape
of Mammon’s rune which burns through even the thickest armour. Mammon loves marking the innocent with his Rune,
as it sows mistrust amongst his enemies.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Coin hammer 2-handed Melee +1D to Injuries HEAVY
Rules: Roll all injuries with +1 DICE. When you inflict a BLOOD MARKER in melee with this weapon, the model
wielding the hammer gains one BLESSING MARKER. LIMIT:2
