The Iron Sultanate
hen the Infidels opened the thrice-
cursed Gate to Jahannam, releasing
Gog and Magog upon those who
believe, it seemed that all was lost and
Shaytan would emerge victorious over
Dunya. But the Creator of the Universe came to the aid
of the Faithful, and as had been written, the great Iron
Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn manifested itself in the lands
ruled by the Sultan of Rûm. A call was sent to those
who believe righteously and, over the coming decades,
the migration of the Faithful took place across Europa,
Asia and Africa. Millions perished on the road and at
sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed
them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring
them and building vile monuments from their limbs
and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed
in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the
journey had come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn
were closed and the Great Sultanate of the Invincible
Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was
formed.
The assaults of the slaves of Jahannam against the
Sultanate have never ceased since that day, and each day
new martyrs are mourned as they defend the Wall and
confront the heretics who have overcome its defences.
But within the walls, the lost knowledge flourishes and
from mosques of white marble and gold the muezzin
call the faithful to pray for the success of the Sultan’s
army as it struggles to protect their lands and defend
the caravan trails that provide the Sultanate with vital
trade goods.
The Iron Wall is the greatest defensive work in the
world, a mighty bulwark festooned with the famed
artillery of the Sultan. Azeb sharpshooters stand at
ready, ever watchful for surprise attacks, and the elite
Janissary regiments have barracks at set intervals near
the wall so they can react to any attack at speed. During
a more serious incursion a full muster of Azebs is
called, the House of Wisdom unleashes its terrifying
takwin creations upon the foe, and if the need is
desperate, the Sultan himself comes forth and his
In the name of Allah, the
Compassionating, the
Compassionate! Praise be to
Allah, The Beneficent King, The
Creator of the Universe, Lord
of the Three Worlds, Who set up
The Firmament without Pillars
in its Stead and Who stretched
out the Earth even as a Bed; and
Grace, and Prayer-Blessing be
upon Our Lord Mohammed, Lord
of Apostolic Men, and upon His
Family and Companion-Train;
Prayer and Blessings Enduring
and Grace Which unto The Day of
Doom shall Remain!
- Scheherazade
  Glory to the Great Sultan, the
  Padishah of Rûm, the Dispenser
  of Crowns to the Monarchs on the
  face of the Earth, and the Shadow
  of God on Earth, Custodian of the
  Invincible Iron Wall of the Two
  Horns that pierce the Sky which
  protects us from the ravages of Gog
  and Magog!
  Janissaries march with him to do battle, carrying their
  green flag before them.
  Thus the protection of the Iron Wall has had an
  extensive influence on the Sultanate Way of war. The
  conscripted Azebs are experts at feigned flight and
  skirmish, while the loping Lions of Jabir harass the
  enemy’s flanks. All the while the superb artillery of
  the Sultan bombards the enemy as they make their
  tortuous journey across the battlefield littered with
  traps set by skilled Sappers. When they reach the
  ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite
  household troops, close in and finish the enemy with
  their devastating counter-charge led by their ironwilled officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl
  in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and
  leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom
  unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their
  elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences
  of virtually any foe.
  Beyond the Iron Wall forces of the Sultan operate
  in small, mobile companies, each with a particular
  mission to accomplish. They hunt down apostates
  that have gone to serve Shaytans, look for the relics
  from the time of the Prophets, or seek to recover lost
  treasures and books of knowledge from the ruins
  of the fallen Caliphates. Though an understanding
  between the Church and the Sultanate on being cobelligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders
  of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and
  do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder
  their mission. Resentment against the infidels who
  unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate,
  and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to
  the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission
  of Those Who Believe.

  Sultanate Special Weapons, Armour & Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Iron Sultanate warband.
  Jezzail
  These long arms are by far the most common weapons carried by the soldiers of the Sultanate of the Great Iron Wall. Their
  barrels are smoothbore which limits their accuracy at range, but this is more than made up for by the fact that this allows
  them to be loaded with different types of alchemical ammunition made by the Jabirean Alchemists.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Jezzail 2-handed 18” - -
  MURAD Bombard
  Named after the great Sultan who commissioned the first of these weapons to defend the Iron Wall, this mighty bombard is
  used to disrupt advancing enemy formations. The echo of its blast recites the 99 names of Allah, throwing even the greatest
  of warriors to ground like chaff.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  MURAD Bombard 1-handed 36” - HEAVY,
  BLAST 3”
  Rules: Specify a point on the battlefield within 36” (must be in line of sight) that you want to target. Next, take a
  Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location,
  multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot lands 2”
  away, as 7-5=2). The direction is decided by your opponent. All models within 3” of the landing 1x1mm landing spot
  are hit as the bomb explodes – no roll to hit is needed. If the bomb lands directly on top of any model, roll with 3D6
  on the Injury Chart and add the dice together to see what happens! Other models hit by the bombard suffer a Down
  result due the booming shockwave, but do not incur any BLOOD MARKERS or other effects from this attack.
  Flame Cannon
  A great cannon that shoots a stream of alchemical fire with tremendous force. It has a tendency to overheat and ignite the
  skin of its artillery crew, but the mighty Brazen Bulls use them as mere handguns. The secret formula used for the fuel of
  the Flame Cannons was gleaned from the lost Byzantine ruins, and is commonly known as Greek Fire.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Flame Cannon 1-handed 12” - HEAVY, FIRE
  Rules: When shot in ranged combat, draw a straight 12” line that is 1mm wide from the Brazen Bull. All models
  along the path of the line are automatically hit – roll for their injuries immediately. Armour does not protect against
  the Flame Cannon. Due to the Keyword FIRE, its hits cause an additional +1 BLOOD MARKER. This is applied after
  rolling for injuries.
  Titan Zulfiqar
  This twin-tongued greatsword can weigh up to 300 pounds – only the mighty Brazen Bulls can even lift this monstrous
  blade, let alone wield it in combat. It sheer weight and mono-molecule sharpness cuts through even the thickest armour
  when swung by the superhuman strength of the takwin monstrosity.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Zulfiqar 1-handed Melee +2 to injury rolls HEAVY,
  CRITICAL
  Rules: Add +2 to the result of all injuries caused by this weapon (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 9).

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Assassin’s Dagger
  The blades of the Assassins are imbued with the Supreme Poison. In chambers deep below the surface, generations of young
  assassins are raised in the dark; fed a diet of scorpions, frogs, deadly mushrooms and even stranger, more noxious things,
  and generation by generation their tolerance grows. The poisonous blood of these willing vessels is drawn and smelted into
  a poisonous iron. The iron is forged into blades and deadly spells of slaying layered into each fold of the envenomed metal.
  Thus the blood of the first generation of Assassins lives to this day, growing more potent with each generation.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Assassin’s Dagger 1-handed Melee +1 to Injury CRITICAL
  Rules: Adds +1 to injury rolls (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 8). If the Assassin hits an enemy and causes
  at least one BLOOD MARKER, the Assassin can move away from combat during this Activation. Note that this move
  does not grant enemies free attacks. Assassins can use both normal and Dash move to do this, though this may not be
  used for charging.
  Halberd-Gun
  Invention of the House of Wisdom, this weapon acts both as a symbol of high rank and an excellent weapon in combat.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Halberd-Gun 2-handed Melee/24” - ASSAULT,
  CUMBERSOME
  Rules: Enemies charging a model equipped with a Halberd-gun add -1 DICE in melee combat when rolling to hit.
  This only applies when a model attacks after a charge, not on subsequent rounds of melee.
  Siege Jezzail
  Heavier version of the standard Jezzail. It is a large, cumbersome weapon with a shot of lead or iron weighing as much as
  four pounds, designed to take out even the most powerful enemies with a single shot. Azebs armed with these weapons use
  tripod stakes when firing them, but the mighty Janissaries often use them as their standard service gun.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Siege Jezzail 2-handed 30” +1D to Injuries HEAVY
  Rules: Roll all injuries with +1 DICE.
  Alaybozan
  The design of this blunderbuss is based on the traditional design of tribal warriors but thoroughly modernised by the
  foundries of the Sultanate. It has proven its worth as the preferred weapon of the Sapper corps who must often fight in
  close quarters. It shoots a hail of lead bullets and iron shrapnel.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Alaybozan 2-handed 12” - SHRAPNEL
  Alchemist Armour
  Suit of armour which protects against almost all harm. This is an essential tool of Alchemists’ craft, festooned with the
  Seals of Solomon which enables them to bend the elements of Creation to their will and shields them even from the
  devices of Hell.
  Rules: Counts as Reinforced Armour and therefore grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls made against the model
  wearing it. All attacks with the Keyword FIRE and/or GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure this model.
  Additionally, this model does not suffer additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keywords FIRE and/or GAS.

  Alchemical Ammunition
  Jabirean Alchemists craft these Jezzail bullets from the slivers of the Iron Wall. Each such shot is carved the Seal of
  Solomon, guiding them during their path through the air.
  Rules: Adds +1 DICE to Ranged Attack rolls on the Action Success Chart. Can only be used with Jezzails,
  Alaybozan, Halberd-Guns and Siege Jezzails.
  Cloak of Alamut
  Created by the secret arts of the Assassin’s sect aeons ago, this cloak bends the light so that its wearer looks almost
  indistinguishable against any surface when they are still. It is this masterwork of Alamut that has led to the tales of the
  fabled Cloak of Invisibility in the legends of the Sultanate.
  Rules: All ranged attacks against a model that is in cover suffer -2 DICE penalty instead of -1 DICE. All the
  normal rules for cover apply otherwise.
  Wind Amulet
  Amulet created by the Jabirean Alchemists, capturing the essence of the Element of Wind within it.
  Rules: Once per battle, you may add +3” to the Movement characteristic of this model once during the activation.
  Declare this when the model is Activated.
  Marid Shovel
  You can buy this enormous shovel made from alchemical bronze which makes it almost indestructible. Brazen bulls use it
  for public works (such as digging canals, foundations of buildings and mining) during peacetime, while at war it is used
  for digging trenches, ditches and bunkers.
  Rules: The Marid Shovel has the Keyword HEAVY which allows a Brazen Bull to use it. Otherwise it works exactly
  like a normal shovel.

  Warband Variant: Fida’i
  of Alamut – The Cabal of
  Assassins
  The pact between the Iron Sultanate and the Assassin
  fortress of Alamut ensures that the Sultan is served by
  the exquisitely skilled killers of the Old Man of the
  Mountain in exchange for independence of the Assassin’s
  domain.
  But though most outsiders know the Assassins through
  their service to the forces of the Iron Wall, sometimes
  during the dark of night small, deadly bands move
  silently into the hellscape of No Man’s Land. In deepest
  secrecy Rashid al-Din Sinan, the undisputed ruler of
  Alamut dispatches his hand-picked disciples on Missions
  of his own, communicating their orders with no spoken
  words, signs nor written messages, but talking directly
  to them in their dreams. What the purpose of such
  operations is no-one knows, and not even the most
  sadistic Heretic torturer-priest has been able to make
  them divulge the secrets of Alamut from captured
  Assassins. These warbands are known as Fida’i (which
  means ‘Sacrifice’), dedicated to completing their mission
  and returning to Alamut to receive rewards said to be
  able to match those of Paradise itself. They are led by a
  Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of Alamut,
  with two fully-trained members of the Order. A number
  of trainee acolytes will serve them during the mission,
  eager to prove their mettle and be initiated into the
  Order of Assassins.
  Alamut is also a home to a renegade sect of Ismaili
  Dervishes, warrior monks sworn to poverty and a lethal
  way of fighting. They accompany the Assassins on their
  secret missions as an act of piety and payment for their
  shelter, and their whirling dance of death has been the
  end of many a disbeliever.
  Fida’i of Alamut Rules
  The Fida’i of Alamut Warband has the following special
  rules:
  ; Flock of Assassins: The Fida’i of Alamut can
  have up to three Assassins. The warband must
  include a Master Assassin that counts as one of the
  three (see below).
  ; Master Assassin: A Master Assassin has the
  Keyword TOUGH. The Master Assassin costs 95
  ducats.
  ; Assassin Acolytes: Up to three Azebs of the
  warband can have the Keyword INFILTRATOR at
  the cost of +10 ducats per model.
  ; Alamut Alone: The warband may not include
  Yüzbaşı, Alchemist, Janissaries, Lions of Jabir or
  Brazen Bulls.
  ; Killing Squad: Your warband may have a single
  Fireteam. These Fireteams may consist of any two
  models from your warband. Models in Fireteams
  gain the Keyword FIRETEAM.
  ; Dervishes: The warband may include up to
  four Dervishes (use Janissary statistics including
  Armoury selection, but they cannot use Reinforced
  Armour). These troops have the Whirling Dervishes
  special rule instead of the Keyword STRONG:
  ; Whirling Dervishes: The ritual Dance of
  the Dervishes is hypnotic to witness, and it is
  as graceful as it is deadly. All Ranged attacks
  against Dervishes suffer -1 DICE penalty.
  Dervishes do not suffer the normal -1 DICE to
  hit for fighting with an Off-Hand weapon.
  Art of Assassination
  Any Assassin of the warband may buy any one of these
  abilities at the cost indicated below. There cannot be any
  duplicates in the warband and you can only buy one for
  each Assassin.
  Hallucinogen Disguise 20 ducats
  An INFILTRATOR with this ability can be deployed
  anywhere on the battlefield, including the enemy
  Deployment Zone, as long as the model is at least 8”
  away from any enemy models. The model does not have
  to be out of Line of Sight. Binoculars or Guard Dogs
  have no effect on this ability.
  Thunderbolt of Alamut 20 ducats
  The model has +2” movement and +1 DICE on its
  Dash ACTIONS.
  Mirage of Time 15 ducats
  Both Ranged and Melee attacks against the Assassin
  suffer -1 DICE penalty when determining if they hit.
  Secret Paths 10 ducats
  At the start of the battle, right before the first model is
  set up, declare whether or not this model will be set up
  by using Secret Paths. A model using the Secret Paths is
  not set up on the battlefield at the start of the battle and
  it may not be activated normally during the first turn.
  Starting in the second turn, you may activate these
  models. When you do, set up the model in contact with
  an edge of the battlefield but more than 8” away from
  all enemy models at the start of its activation. If both
  players have such models, the starting player declares
  whether one of their models is deployed or not first,
  followed by the other player. Alternate as normal until
  all such models have been declared as using Secret Paths
  or not.

  Fida’i of Alamut Special Weapons and Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Fida’i of Alamut Warband.
  Golden Khanjar 20 ducats
  Placed on a hand of an especially favoured killer by the Old Man of the Mountain himself, these wickedly curved daggers
  gleam as if they were made of gold, but instead they are crystallised poison, and allow their wielder to attack twice in the
  same instance of time. Only the Master of Alamut himself knows the secret of making these blades.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Golden Khanjar 1-handed Melee +1 Injury, 2 Attacks
  Rules: Adds +1 to injury rolls (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 8). A model armed with a Golden Khanjar
  can make two attacks instead of one in melee with one Melee Attack ACTION. This effect also applies to a Golden
  Khanjar wielded off-hand.
  Assassin Only, LIMIT: 2
  Bow of Alamut 50 ducats
  This terrifying double-stringed bow shoots its deadly barbs through both time and space. Its arrows can reach impossible
  distances and pass through armour by flickering through time. It leaves behind a temporal slipstream that the Assassin can
  travel through in an eyeblink.
  Made from wood taken from trees planted in the skulls of ancient assassins in the Garden of Alamut so that they might
  absorb mystic powers of their former owners, these bows are some of the greatest treasures of the Old Man of the Mountain
  for it is said that only six now remain in his secret armouries.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Bow of Alamut 2-handed 40” Ignores Armour CRITICAL
  Rules: Ignores Armour. If the Assassin hits a model and causes at least one BLOOD MARKER, the Assassin may
  instantly place itself into Melee Combat with that model if there is a legal space that the Assassin could occupy
  within 1” of that model, regardless of the distance to the target or any interposing models/obstacles. The Assassin is
  considered to have charged that model, although it does not count as a Charge ACTION and therefore the Assassin
  can take the Move ACTION at a later point on this turn, if it hasn’t already. Note that if the bow takes the target Out
  of Action, no BLOOD MARKERS are caused and this movement cannot be made.
  Assassin Only, LIMIT: 1
  Hashashin Leaf 5 ducats
  These leaves from the secret Garden of Alamut enhance the strength of anyone who eats them threefold. Once the effect
  wears off the subject will suffer from agonising muscle tears and ripping of ligaments, but many of the Order of Assassins
  feel that this is a small price to pay for being able to use deadlier weapons.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to gain the Keyword STRONG until the end of a battle.
  CONSUMABLE, LIMIT: 4.

  Warband Variant:
  The House of Wisdom
  “Read in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who
  Created man, out of a clot of congealed blood: Proclaim!
  And thy Lord is Most Bountiful, He Who taught the pen,
  Taught man that which he knew not.”
  -Surah 96
  The House of Wisdom is the pre-eminent centre
  of learning within the Iron Sultanate. Its libraries,
  workshops, forges, gardens of exotic and wondrous
  plants, hospitals and observatories are unmatched.
  Within its halls are mechanical marvels and weapons
  from far-off lands, as well as trophies captured by the
  Sultan’s forces and brought to be examined by the
  learned scholars of the House of Wisdom. Philosophers
  and theologists debate in its chambers; ghanzal and
  qasīda poets compose verses describing the beauty and
  pain of life. Thus it is no wonder that the House attracts
  the greatest minds of the age to study in its hallowed
  halls, from within the Sultanate and far beyond the Iron
  Wall.
  In its laboratories guarded by the faithful Kavass, the
  Jabirean Alchemists dissect and study the War Beasts
  of Shaitan so their weaknesses can be laid bare and
  exploited by the Believers. At such times, their roars of
  rage and pain echo through the porphyry corridors of
  the House.
  To maintain a degree of independence, regardless of the
  royal funding, the House of Wisdom performs many
  services for the Sultan’s armies. Their best alchemists
  work with the Sultanate foundries where the Great
  Cannons of the Iron Wall are cast. Takwin creations are
  provided to bolster the army of Those Who Believe, as
  are suits of armour and alchemical ammunition. The
  House of Wisdom also maintains the Sultanate fleet of
  airships, which both guard the realms of Those Who
  Believe against enemy air forces and maintain vigil over
  lands under darkness. They make regular excursions
  deep into enemy territory to witness whether the Great
  Sandstorm still covers the Two Holy Places, reporting
  any news back to the Sultan.
  In exchange, the masters of the House of Wisdom
  have freedom to despatch their own excursions and
  expeditions into the lands beyond the wall, to seek tomes
  of knowledge lost in the dark and terrible days when
  the forces of Jahannam overran much of the Levant
  and great cities fell like blossoms of a Jasmine flower in
  fiery heat. Sometimes they are journeys to capture an
  especially ferocious beast of the enemy. At other times
  they seek to capture or kill Heretic Alchemists which
  they see as both an offence to their craft and a threat to
  the entire world.
  These journeys are exceedingly dangerous and they are
  not undertaken lightly. Each Alchemist dispatched on
  such a journey is an irreplaceable loss, and since they
  operate under their own authority, they cannot expect
  direct support from the Sultan’s forces. Many noble Fāris
  warriors have taken oaths to protect these scholars in
  their journeys, as well as their own Kavass bodyguards
  sworn to fight and die in defence of their Masters.
  House of Wisdom Rules
  The House of Wisdom warband has the following
  special rules:
  ; Alchemists: The House of Wisdom warband
  may have up to two Alchemists and must include at
  least one. This warband treats Alchemist Armour as
  if they had a LIMIT of 2.
  ; Pride of Jabir: The warband may include up to
  three Lions of Jabir.
  ; Private Venture: The warband may not include
  any Azebs, Janissaries, Yüzbaşi or Assassins.
  ; Noble Guardians: The warband may include up
  to two Fāris – noble warriors sworn to protect the
  House of Wisdom. They use the Janissary stats but
  have the Keywords ELITE and STRONG.
  ; Kavass: Kavass are sworn guardians of the House
  of Wisdom. They use Azebs stats but cannot buy the
  Keyword SKIRMISHER. Instead, up to three Kavass
  can increase their Melee Characteristic by +1 DICE
  (to +0D) at the cost of +5 ducats per model.
  ; Weapon Collections: When you create this
  warband, choose two weapons. These weapons must
  be found in either the Armouries of New Antioch
  or the Trench Pilgrims. These weapons must not
  already be present in the Iron Sultanate Armoury.
  Your warband may acquire one from New Antioch
  and one from the Trench Pilgrim armoury, following
  all of the same limitations and costs of the original
  lists. Only one weapon can be picked from this list.
  If lost in battle, it can be repurchased by paying the
  indicated cost.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Secrets of the House of Wisdom
  Any Alchemist of the warband may buy any one of these Abilities at the cost indicated below. You cannot have
  duplicates of these abilities in the Warband, as the House of Wisdom does not want to risk depleting the number of
  their scholars in a single discipline.
  Medicine 15 ducats
  This Alchemist is a student of Ibn Sina’s School of Medicine. The model is equipped with tools for healing from the
  House of Wisdom. The Alchemist can take an ACTION with +1 DICE to remove up to two BLOOD MARKERS
  or a single INFECTION MARKER from any one friendly model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow
  one friendly model (including themselves) who is Down to regain their footing. This training and these tools are an
  improvement upon the standard Medi-Kit and therefore a model with this Secret cannot carry a Medi-Kit.
  Cartography & Geometry 20 ducats
  The Alchemist has studied long and hard the sciences of cartography and geometry. At the beginning of each battle,
  immediately before any models are deployed, up to two models in your warband gain the Keyword INFILTRATOR,
  This ability cannot affect an Alchemist or a model with a base larger than 32mm. In addition, the warband may reroll one Exploration dice in the Exploration phase if you wish. The second result stands.
  Secrets of Takwin 20 ducats
  The Alchemist has bound their Takwin creature to themselves with unbreakable bonds. If the Alchemist is hit by
  an attack while within 1” of their Homunculus, you may redirect the hit to the Homunculi instead. Determine the
  injuries and additional effects exactly as if the weapon just hit the Homunculi.
  Chemistry & Alchemy 25 ducats
  Before the battle starts, but after all models (including INFILTRATORS) are deployed, you may place a rectangular
  elemental obstacle 2” wide and 6” long. It counts both as Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain, and damage it
  causes has the Keyword FIRE, GAS or SHRAPNEL (chosen when the obstacle is placed). It cannot be placed within
  6” of any model or on top of any other Terrain.
  Philosophy, Poetry and Theology 20 ducats
  The Alchemist is well-versed in the hidden truths of the universe and of the Divine, and has a calm and clear mind.
  The warband gains +1 DICE to all Morale Rolls, cannot become Shaken and the Alchemist plus another model of
  your choice is immune to the effects of the Keyword FEAR.
  63
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Takwin Creatures
  You can bring one Takwin creature for each Alchemist in your warband. Each Takwin creature must be associated
  with an Alchemist in your warband. If a Takwin creature’s associated Alchemist is killed (typically by acquiring three
  scars), that Takwin creature cannot be fielded, its equipment cannot be changed and no Alchemical Formulae may
  be applied to it. When you acquire a new Alchemist, if you have any unallocated Takwin creatures, you must allocate
  that new Alchemist with one of your unallocated Takwin creatures. Instead of using Glory, you must buy them with
  ducats as indicated on the list below.
  Takwin Homunculus 40 ducats
  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base
  Homunculus 6”/Infantry +0 Dice +0 Dice 0 25mm
  Equipment
  The homunculus cannot be equipped with any weapons, armour or equipment. It can fight in melee without any
  penalty.
  Abilities
  ; Re-creation: If the Homunculus is taken Out of Action during battle, and is deemed to have been killed in
  the post-battle sequence, you do not have to remove it from your roster. Instead, you can spend 40 ducats at any
  time between battles to bring it back to life with all of its weapons and abilities.
  ; Artificial Body: Created through the Jabirean alchemy, the Homunculus has no vital organs and they have to
  be dismembered in order to kill them. All injury rolls against the Homunculus are made with -1 DICE.
  Keywords
  SULTANATE
  Alchemical formulae
  You may buy any of these Alchemical Formulae for your Homunculus, either during its creation or later during any
  Post-Battle Sequence, as long as you pay the price of each formula. Once bought they are permanent.
  You can never have more than one Alchemic Formula of the same type applied into a single Takwin creature unless
  otherwise specified.
  ; Wings (30 ducats): The Homunculus gains a new movement mode: 8”/Flying.
  ; Elemental Resistance (40 ducats): Attacks made against the Homunculus that have the Keywords FIRE
  and/or GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure it. Also the Homunculus does not suffer additional BLOOD
  MARKERS from attacks with Keywords FIRE and/or GAS.
  ; Massive size (30 ducats): The Homunculus’ size is increased to huge proportions. It now has a base size of
  50mm and it gains the Keyword TOUGH. This formula cannot be combined with the Wings formula.
  ; Enslaved Mind (10 ducats): The Homunculus gains the Keyword FIRETEAM along with one model of your
  choice in the Warband. The other model can only form a Fireteam with this Homunculi, not with any other
  models.
  ; Human hands (10 ducats): The Homunculus can buy and wield any weapon allowed in the Iron Sultanate
  warband or House of Wisdom list, though they cannot select ELITE only items, grenades or items limited
  to specific units (such as Assassins). They can also carry a Trench Shield or a Fire Shield. This will apply to the
  Additional Arms formula as well. Cannot be combined with the Wings formula.
  ; Inhuman Strength (15 ducats): The musculature of the Homunculus is reinforced, replaced and
  strengthened. It now has a base size of 32mm (or 50mm if it also has Massive size). The Homunculus gains +1
  DICE to its Melee characteristic and the Keyword STRONG.
  ; Terrifying Appearance (10 ducats): Whether by captivating beauty or a terrifying appearance, this
  Homunculus gains the Keyword FEAR.
  ; Additional Arm (15 ducats): The Homunculus can perform an additional attack ACTION in Melee or
  Ranged combat without any penalty. Therefore, if making attacks with three melee weapons, only a single
  64
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  weapon would need to be declared an Off-Hand weapon (suffering the appropriate penalties). It has three hands
  to carry weapons if combined with Human Hands, and may equip weapons and a shield in any combination, as
  long as it has hands free to do so. In this case the Homunculi can make up to two Ranged Attack ACTIONS (if it
  has sufficient weapons and number of hands to carry them), and up to three Melee Attack ACTIONS (if armed
  with three one-handed weapons); or one Melee Attack ACTION with a two-handed weapon and one Melee
  Attack ACTION with a one-handed weapon.
  ; Two heads (5 ducats): The Homunculus has two heads and therefore can have two sets of eyes via Alchemical
  Formula.
  ; Hypnotic Eyes (15 ducats): Enemies suffer -1 DICE to hit the Homunculus in Melee. Does not affect
  Sniper Priests or enemies with the keyword BLACK GRAIL. Cannot be combined with Hawk Eyes without Two
  Heads.
  ; Hawk Eyes (10 ducats): The eyesight of the Homunculus is based on that of a predatory bird. It can add +1
  DICE to its Ranged Attack characteristic. Cannot be combined with Hypnotic Eyes without Two Heads.
  ; Startling Speed (10 ducats): The Homunculus adds +1 DICE to its Dash ACTIONS.
  ; Seal of Solomon (10 ducats): This Formula greatly enhances the intelligence of the Homunculus and makes
  it painfully aware of its artificial existence. It can now buy and use Equipment from the Sultanate Warband
  Armoury as long as it is not limited to ELITE models. Note that one helmet protects a Homunculus with two
  heads normally and the Two Heads Formula does not allow the purchase of two different kinds of headgear.
  ; Gargantuan Size (20 ducats): Can only be bought if the Homunculus already has the Human Hands,
  Inhuman Strength and Massive Size Formulas. The Homunculus now has a Base Size of 60mm and it can now
  use one Brazen Bull Only weapon.
  ; Regenerative Tissue (25 ducats): The Homunculus has an astonishing healing factor and can remove one
  BLOOD MARKER every time it is Activated, if it has any.
  House of Wisdom Special Armoury
  The following items are exclusively available to the House of Wisdom warband.
  Elixir of Al-Khidr 10 ducats
  An extraordinary creation of the House of Wisdom. It is said that within its Gardens is the hidden Fountain of Life that is
  used as an ingredient of this powerful Alchemical formula.
  Rules: Gives the model consuming the Elixir Keyword TOUGH for the duration of a single battle. It cannot be given
  to Lions of Jabir, Brazen Bulls or Homunculi.
  CONSUMABLE, LIMIT: 1
  Fire Shield 20 ducats
  An Invention of the al-Jazari school of engineering within the House of Wisdom, this shield is treated with an Alchemical
  formula, making it highly resistant to fire weapons. It has proven its value in many desperate battles against the flamewielding Heretics.
  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat. Grants -1 to all injury rolls against the
  model. This bonus stacks with any armour the model wears, unless otherwise indicated. Any attack against this model
  that has the Keyword FIRE will suffer -1 DICE on injury rolls and will not cause an additional BLOOD MARKER.
  LIMIT: 2
