# The Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent

> Jutting from eternally belching plumes of stinking, corrosive smoke is the Iron City of Dis; and atop its shrieking,
> black keep can be found the Infernal War Council. There sits seven of the greatest, most wicked and cunning of
> Arch-Devils, each representing one of the Seven Mortal Sins made manifest. They are the rulers of the Court of the
> Seven-Headed Serpent which oversees Hell’s war against Creation on Earth. Each is known as one of the Heads of the
> Serpent, and ultimately it is their commands that dictate all the military forces of the Great War in the service of the
> infernal hierarchy.

In this twisted, treacherous and ever-shifting political arena, even the mightiest of Devils rarely sit at the great War
Council for long. Towering statues of the Serpent Heads representing Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth and Lust
are erected in Dis by slavering work gangs of yoke fiends, only to be torn down again and crushed into rubble as new
Devil Lords rise to the pinnacle of power by trampling over their rivals.

The hierarchy of the Court is anything but stable: only Mammon is said to have held the position of the Serpent Head of
Greed almost without break for the duration of the entire Great War. Other positions have seen a bewildering parade of
dukes, marquises, margraves, barons and baronesses, paramounts, princes, lords, ladies, earls and myriad other high
nobles that make up the infernal hierarchy. This whirlwind of political glory, followed by utter ruin, is reflected as
shifts of power amongst their mortal followers on earth. The Council operates on majority vote and often with the
thinnest of margins. It takes very little for an ambitious prince or princess of Hell to make so many enemies that they
are deposed and their wings torn, forced them to begin their ascent from the bottom once more, with the mockery of their
rivals burning them like venom.

Countless envious pretenders work against the Heads of the Serpent, seeking to replace them and gain the glory and
prestige that comes with such a lofty position. The might of the demons also waxes and wanes based on how many mortal
followers they can corrupt to their cause, and thus there is a constant change in which demon lords can don one of the
seven serpent-headed crowns.

While Beelzebub is the most powerful Devil of Gluttony by far, the Lord of the Flies scorns his rightful place at the
Court, waging his battle against creation through his Black Grail instead. This leaves his seat open so the lesser
fallen angels can struggle for the honour of sitting on the Hungry Throne.

Upon the commands of the Court, the warbands of Hell gather at the Hellgate and strike out to blight our unhappy world.
Yoke fiends muster under the banners of their praetors and sorcerers. The shattered forms of the Hell Knights are forced
into their suits of armour, emerging from their fiery tombs where their bodies are kept crushed under mighty,
ever-turning slabs of black basalt while they are not serving in the war effort. Desecrated Saints are brought forth to
act as unholy war altars that pollute and pervert the land which they travel over. Ahead of the warbands fly Pit
Locusts, the clatter of their wings heralding the coming of the Court, their poison stings leaving burns that cannot be
healed. And sometimes, when the deathly omens in Hell’s burning sky and black stars are favourable, a Hunter of the
Left-hand Path will join a warband as they strike out from the Mouth of Hell. As the warband marches to join the Great
War, joyous and triumphant music played by unseen hands can be heard at these times, for taking part in one of these
hunts is seen as a great privilege within the Sheol.

Before most warbands, the whips of the yoke fiends drive living human slave soldiers of the Court known as the wretched.
These unfortunate souls possess not a drop of demon blood. They act as disposable shock troops or are used as subjects
of torture to power the Goetic magic of the sorcerers and other users of the dark arts. Captured during one of the hunts
of the Court, sold to the devils in the heretic domains or having the misfortune to have foolishly pushed through in the
places where the borders of the world are thin, their minds are scarred by witnessing the horror of damnation while
still alive. Willing to do anything to escape their fate a million times worse than death, they grasp at the thinnest of
straws. Should a wretch bring down a mighty opponent, the Law of Hell is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom, in
memory and honour of the First Rebellion when there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels painted the firmament red.

## The Court and the Great War

When the Gate of Hell was opened by the Ultimate Heresy of the Templars, it was the warbands of the Court that poured
out and took the Levant by the storm, long before the first Heretic Legion was ever formed. They fell upon the people of
the Middle East, Asia and Europa. They crushed the mortal armies sent against them like fire burning dry chaff. Only at
Antioch and at the Iron Wall were they eventually checked, though at a terrible cost. Meanwhile, awed even by these
least of Hell’s servants, countless men and women fell to their knees at the sight of the dark splendour of the Court
and worshipped them as gods. Those with truly wicked hearts were spared and they became the first heretics. Eventually
their numbers would swell into the millions who now fill the teeming cities and domains under the shadow of the
Hellgate.

Being both of the material world and of the world of spirit, the Court’s foot soldiers can march to make war on Earth
without a fear of divine retribution as they do not break the Covenant of Hell. The Court also carefully limits the size
of these warbands, so that most of the suffering and dying of the Great War is done by mortals, both to spite the
God-Tyrant YHWH, but also to enhance their own power, as more humans are corrupted and die in the rebellion, the more
God’s plan is disturbed and the greater the power of the devils waxes.

The missions of the Court against the Faithful do not follow the same logic as one a mortal commander might have. A
mighty praetor could strike at a militarily insignificant village only to kill a new-born future saint, betray their own
mortal followers by suddenly falling upon some unsuspecting heretic settlement or even clash with a warband of a rival
Head of the Serpent. The wise do not question the motives of Hell’s rage and Heretics accept these occasional attacks
against their forces as a fitting judgement for their lack of success in the war against the Faithful.

## Warband Creation

* **Starting Funds:** You have \(700\) ducats to recruit your initial Force in the campaign.
* **One-Off Battles:** For one-off battles, we suggest a typical force of \(900\) ducats and \(8\) Glory Points.

### Seven Deadly Sins

You must select which of the Seven Deadly Sins the warband is dedicated to: Choose either **Wrath**, **Envy**, **Pride
**, **Gluttony**, **Greed**, **Sloth** or **Lust**.

### Keyword Demonic

Due to their infernal origins, models with the Keyword `DEMONIC` negate additional `BLOOD MARKERS` caused by the Keyword
`FIRE`.

## The Court Armoury

The Court troops can be equipped with the following weapons, armour and equipment. All exceptions are clearly listed
here on the entries for each warrior or in the list below. If any item is marked as `LIMIT`, you can only have as many
of these weapons at any point during the campaign as indicated in the brackets. Armaments marked as `ELITE` only are
limited to the models with that Keyword.

## The Court Special Equipment

### Arquebus

> A primitive matchlock weapon that is simple enough that even a yoke fiend is capable of operating it.

| Name     | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Arquebus | 2-handed | 18”   | -         | -        |

* **Rules:** If a model equipped with an arquebus has two hands free, it can use it in melee combat as if it were a
  trench club.

### Ophidian Rifle

> This wheel-lock hunting rifle is produced in the forges of the demon Sabnock, the Great Marquis of War. Made of both
> infernal and earthly metals and materials, it exists simultaneously in the twisted dimension of Hell as well as on
> Earth. A thing that should not be, the shots of this firearm pervert the laws of God, so taking cover from its bullets
> and firing over great distances aid the user of this hell-made rifle instead of hindering the aim.

| Name           | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Ophidian Rifle | 2-handed | 30”   | -         | `HEAVY`  |

* **Rules:** This weapon ignores the penalties for Cover and Long Range, and rolls attacks against models at Long Range
  or in Cover with \(+1\) DICE. These bonuses stack for a possible total of \(+2\) DICE.

### Serpent Assault Gun

> This terrifying and enormous hand cannon contains a portal to the foetid swamps and bogs of the Fifth Circle of Hell.
> Each bullet it fires is enveloped with an awful gas.

| Name        | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords                  |
|:------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:--------------------------|
| Serpent Gun | 2-handed | 36”   | -         | `GAS`, `HEAVY`, `ASSAULT` |

* **Rules:** When this model takes this ranged attack `ACTION`, it can make up to two attacks with this weapon. These
  attacks can target separate models, but the targets must be within 6” of each other.

### Bow of Lethe

> This bow is grown by the Hunters of the Left-Hand Path out of their own flesh. It can be tipped with a deadly poison
> made from the blood of the nameless beasts that the Hunters stalk in the wastelands of Hell, or it can shoot one of the
> iron bolts of Pandemonium that weigh nine tonnes on Earth.

| Name         | Type     | Range | Modifiers                                   | Keywords  |
|:-------------|:---------|:------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------|
| Bow of Lethe | 1-handed | 24”   | \(+2\text{D}\) to Injuries / Ignores Armour | `ASSAULT` |

* **Rules:** Before rolling an injury for this weapon, choose one of the following effects to apply to that roll:
    * The injury ignores armour
    * Roll the injury with \(+2\) DICE

### Torture Instrument

> Great scourges made from living spines, red-hot rods, man-catchers and all the tools of torment fashioned by the
> sadistic smiths of Dis are widely used by Court warbands. Their main function is not to kill, but to cause as much
> agonising pain as possible. Forged in hellfire and quenched in the black waters of river Styx. The agony their wounds
> bring lasts for days.

| Name               | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:-------------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Torture Instrument | 2-handed | Melee | -         | -        |

* **Rules:** This weapon rolls \(D6\) on the Injury Chart, or \(2D6\) on a `BLOODBATH`. This weapon causes an additional
  `BLOOD MARKER` for each `BLOOD MARKER` it inflicts from an injury result.

### Hellblade

> Crafted from iron ore from the mines of Dis in Inferno, this weapon burns with unquenchable fires as it has been
> plunged into Phlegethon, the burning river of blood, one of the five great rivers in Hell.

| Name      | Type     | Range | Modifiers                  | Keywords |
|:----------|:---------|:------|:---------------------------|:---------|
| Hellblade | 2-handed | Melee | \(+1\text{D}\) to Injuries | `FIRE`   |

* **Rules:** This weapon rolls for injuries with \(+1\) DICE. Because this weapon has the Keyword `FIRE`, it inflicts an
  additional `BLOOD MARKER` on a hit.

### Head Taker

> Said to contain a tiny sliver of the stone that Cain used to murder Abel, this weapon allows its wielder to clearly
> see each spot in the body of their enemy that would bring it instant and agonising death. This makes it a superb ambush
> weapon much favoured by the Hunters of the Left-Hand Path.

| Name       | Type     | Range | Modifiers                           | Keywords |
|:-----------|:---------|:------|:------------------------------------|:---------|
| Head taker | 1-handed | Melee | \(+2\) to Injuries vs not Activated | -        |

* **Rules:** This weapon rolls injuries against unactivated models with a flat \(+2\) bonus.

### Malebranche Sword

> These forked abyssal swords are both terrible weapons as well as symbols of prestige, given to demons who have
> performed great deeds in the service of the Court. They were once carried by fallen Seraphim in battles against Heaven.

| Name              | Type     | Range | Modifiers           | Keywords |
|:------------------|:---------|:------|:--------------------|:---------|
| Malebranche Sword | 2-handed | Melee | \(3D6\) Injury roll | `HEAVY`  |

* **Rules:** This enormous evil sword rolls \(3D6\) on the Injury Chart, adding the results together.

### Crown of Hellfire

> This burning crown is held aloft by the pain-seared hands of an invisible damned soul, whose weeping cries can still
> be heard. It is a reward that an elite member of the Court can earn through some extraordinary act in the service of the
> Serpent Head they are pledged to. Of the slave soldiers of the Court, only the Pit Locusts are allowed to wear this
> symbol of prestige due the fundamental role they played at the start of the Great War.

* **Rules:** When this model ends its Activation, each enemy model in melee combat with it suffers a `BLOOD MARKER`. Any
  effect or ability that negates `BLOOD MARKERS` from the Keyword `FIRE` negates this `BLOOD MARKER`.

### Infernal Iron Armour

> This armour is forged simultaneously in Hell and on Earth, so that no weapon, whether infernal or man-made, can
> overcome its protection. It serves both as protection and a torturous prison for the Hell Knights that are forced to
> wear it.

* **Rules:** Injuries against this model are rolled with a flat \(-2\) penalty. This penalty applies against injuries
  that ignore armour.

### Restraining Muzzle

> Yoke Fiends are unruly beasts, and almost impossible to control when they smell mortal blood. Court nobles use these
> cruel, barbed muzzles to bring them to heel. Each is attuned to the will of the noble in the charge, who can constrict
> them until the pain becomes so unbearable that even the most bestial Yoke Fiend is made to obey.

* **Rules:** Any Yoke Fiend equipped with a Restraining Muzzle is not affected by the `Hateful` rule and therefore does
  not have to charge certain enemies within Charge range. With this device in place, the unruly Yoke Fiends can be
  trained better and add \(+1\) DICE to their Ranged Attack characteristic.
* **Restrictions:** `THE COURT` only, Yoke Fiends only, `LIMIT: 3`

## Goetic Powers & Spells

Many of the warriors of the Court have access to Goetic abilities – Powers and Spells which use the suffering of mortals
as spiritual energy to unleash the reality-bending powers of the Demons. As God’s plan for the universe is disrupted and
perverted, the infernal sorcerers and other demonic creatures can use the released primordial energy of Creation to
alter reality. Demons have to be quick, however: God’s omnipotence will soon reassert itself and the opportunity for
Demons to disturb the world is lost. Thus infernal creatures have a continuous and growing need for human sacrifices,
pain and endless warfare to enable their supernatural powers.

Goetic Spells are marked with the Keyword `GOETIC (x)` where the number in brackets indicates how many `BLOOD MARKERS`
will have to be spent to trigger the effect of the Spell. If multiple numbers or a range of numbers are listed in the
brackets, any one of those numbers can be chosen. These `BLOOD MARKERS` can be taken from any model currently taking
part in the battle, be they friendly or enemy models. However, they must come from models that do not have the Keyword
`DEMONIC` or `BLACK GRAIL`.

`BLOOD MARKERS` used this way are removed from the game and the described effect of the Goetic Spell or ability then
takes effect as described – no `ACTION` roll is needed, unless outlined in the spell. Despite not requiring an `ACTION`
roll, Goetic Spells are `ACTIONS` and, as with other `ACTIONS`, spells can only be used by the model once per
Activation. Some Goetic Powers are not marked with the Keyword `GOETIC (x)`. These powers are typically passive
abilities.

### Seven Deadly Sins

Many of the warriors of the Court have access to a selection of devastating Spells and other Powers as detailed in the
list below which can be purchased at the indicated cost when the model is initially purchased. Depending on the type of
model and which Deadly Sin the warband is dedicated to, the selection available to you may vary. All such limitations
are clearly marked below.

#### Any Warband

* **Burning Inferno (15 ducats)**
    * As a Ranged Attack `ACTION` with `GOETIC (1-3)` spell the Sorcerer opens a portal to the Lake of Fire and draws
      forth a great screaming ball of infernal lava mixed with damned souls. Select a \(1x1\)mm point within 36” that
      the Sorcerer can see. Next, make a ranged attack `ACTION`: this attack suffers penalties for Long Range but not
      for Cover. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the fireball lands 1” away from its intended location,
      multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the fireball lands 2”
      away, as \(7-5=2\)). The direction is decided by your opponent. The Burning Inferno has the Keyword `BLAST X”`,
      where X is the amount of `BLOOD MARKERS` spent. Additionally, if the Burning Inferno lands directly on top of a
      model, it ignores that model’s armour. This attack has the Keyword `FIRE`.
    * *Sorcerer only, any Warband*

* **Slavemaster (10 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (1)` spell, this model can command any friendly Yoke Fiend within 12” to do one of the following:
        * **Move:** The Yoke Fiend takes a Standard Move `ACTION` of up to 6”.
        * **Ranged Attack:** The Yoke Fiend takes a Ranged Attack `ACTION` with any Ranged weapon it has.
        * **Melee Attack:** The Yoke Fiend takes a Melee Attack `ACTION`.
        * **Sacrifice:** The Yoke Fiend kills itself (it is removed from the board immediately as a casualty).
    * *`ELITE` only, any Warband*

#### Wrath

* **Charge of Hatred (10 ducats)**
    * When this model Charges, it can always move the maximum distance of 12”, although it suffers penalties to this
      movement as standard (Difficult Terrain, Standing etc.). Additionally, it must make a `RISKY ACTION` to Charge an
      enemy model other than the closest one.
    * *`ELITE` only, Wrath Warband only, `LIMIT: 3`*
* **Lesser Mark of Cain (20 ducats)**
    * An inferior copy of the mark that God-Tyrant YHWH placed on the forehead of Cain, the First Murderer. Injuries
      against this model are rolled with \(-1\) DICE.
    * *`ELITE` only, Wrath Warband only, `LIMIT: 1`*
* **Blind Rage (10 ducats)**
    * This model rolls to Dash with \(+1\) DICE.
    * *`ELITE` only, Wrath Warband only, `LIMIT: 3`*

#### Envy

* **Envious Eyes (5 ducats)**
    * This model can be equipped with one weapon or suit of armour (excluding shields) from the Trench Pilgrim, New
      Antioch or Iron Sultanate warband armouries, including ranged weapons. You must pay the cost of this item as
      standard and, if it is lost, it must be purchased again as soon as you have the funds. This item follows the
      normal limitations. The model will never willingly trade this item away or allow it to be removed. A Sorcerer with
      this Power can be equipped with a ranged weapon purchased in this way, even though they can normally only equip
      melee weapons.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Envy Warband only*
* **Coveted Position (10 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (2)` Spell, this model changes positions with any other model it can see within 12”, as long as the
      bases of the models fit into their positions. This cannot be done if either model is engaged in Melee Combat.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Envy Warband only*
* **What is Yours is Mine (10 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (1)` Spell, this model can remove a `BLOOD` or `BLESSING MARKER` from any model that it can see. This
      model then gains a marker of that type. This marker can come from models regardless of their Keywords and is
      separate from the `BLOOD MARKER` used to cast this spell.
    * *`ELITE` only, Envy Warband only*

#### Lust

* **Forbidden Pleasures (10 ducats)**
    * Before the Battle begins, select one model in your warband without the Keyword `DEMONIC`. It starts the Battle
      with three `BLOOD MARKERS`.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Lust Warband only*
* **Exquisite Pain (15 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (1-2)` Spell, this model inflicts X `BLOOD MARKERS` on an enemy model that it can see, where X is the
      amount of `BLOOD MARKERS` spent.
    * *`ELITE` only, Lust Warband only*
* **Call of Flesh (15 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (2)` Spell that ends this model’s Activation, beckoning magic fills the air. When the enemy next
      Activates a model during this Turn, that model must Move as its first `ACTION`. This Move must be a Retreat if the
      model started its Activation in Melee Combat with a model other than the caster of this Spell. If that model is
      Down, it instead Stands and then Moves. During this movement, it moves in a direct path toward the caster of this
      Spell through any passable terrain, including Dangerous Terrain, Jumping Down etc. The model suffers injuries as
      normal. It can act normally after taking the prescribed `ACTION(S)`, or attempting to take the prescribed
      `ACTION(S)` if it couldn’t, but cannot target the caster of this Spell during this Activation with ranged or melee
      attacks.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Lust Warband only*

#### Pride

* **Proud Defiance (15 ducats)**
    * While this model is on the battlefield, its Warband automatically succeeds Morale Tests.
    * *`ELITE` only, Pride Warband only*
* **Too Proud to Fall (10 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (2)` Spell, when this model would otherwise fall Down for any reason, it instead doesn’t. If used to
      negate a Down result, this model still suffers any `BLOOD MARKER` as normal. This Spell can be cast outside of
      this model’s Activation. Note that if a `TOUGH` model suffers an Out of Action result, which is then converted
      into Down, this Spell can be used, but `TOUGH` is considered to have been used.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Pride Warband only*
* **Light of Samael (15 ducats)**
    * As a `GOETIC (2)` Spell, this model can hit an enemy model it can see within 24” with punishing light. That model
      rolls on the Injury Chart. If the target is on a 32mm or smaller base and was not taken Out of Action, it is
      pushed \(D6\)” directly away from the caster of this Spell, stopping if it hits another model or a solid object.
      They also stop if they would otherwise enter Impassable Terrain or if they would be pushed out of the battlefield.
    * *Praetor or Sorcerer only, Pride Warband only*

#### Sloth

* **Morphean Mind (15 ducats)**
    * The mind of this Demonic creature warps the flow of time so it can take as long as it wishes to decide on its
      actions. No more than one `BLOOD MARKER` at a time can be used to negatively affect an `ACTION` or `RISKY ACTION`
      this model takes.

> Hell. Yoke devils muster at their command and Hell Knights bound to blind obedience bend their knees to these field
> commanders of Hell.

### 0-1 Sorcerer (75 Ducats)

> Sorcerers come in many forms and manipulate their own bodies to better cast the mighty spells they are charged with.
> Some have many arms, others multiple heads or countless alterations and terrible improvements – some self-administered,
> others by force – based on the whims of the Arch-devil and their cabal of High Sorcerers who lead their Goetic strategy.
> A Sorcerer’s feet do not touch the ground – a distant echo of their angelic past – but instead float across No Man’s
> Land, chanting the cruel gospel of Hell as they advance. Their dark wisdom and cunning make them equally capable of
> leading one of the Court’s warbands or acting as advisors to one of the Praetors as they stride forth into the mortal
> realms.

### 0-1 Hunter of the Left-hand Path (110 Ducats)

> The hunters of the Court of the Seven-headed Serpent are followers of the Left-hand Path. They stalk the primordial
> hinterlands of hell, where they hunt terrifying beasts and perform vile magicks and auguries, using the innards of their
> still-living prey to discern portents and omens.

| Name   | Movement    | Ranged      | Melee       | Armour | Base |

| Hunter | 6”/Infantry | \(+2\) Dice | \(+1\) Dice | 0      | 32mm |

  weapon and it cannot swap or lose this weapon. It always takes the use of one of the arms of the Hunter.

#### Abilities

* **Shadow Walker:** As a Retreat `ACTION` with `GOETIC (2)`, the Hunter Retreats from Melee Combat without enemy models
  getting any free attacks against it.
* **Left-Hand Path:** Once during its Activation, when the Hunter moves into contact with a piece of scenery at least 2”
  wide, it can cast this `GOETIC (2)` Spell to walk the path between Hell and Creation. Remove the Hunter and
  immediately place it into contact with any other piece of scenery over 2” wide on the battlefield, including on top of
  or inside it. The Hunter then continues its movement as normal. It can cast this Spell again as part of the same
  movement, spending a `BLOOD MARKER` each time, but it cannot cast it later as part of a different movement during the
  same Activation. This spell can be cast as part of any movement the Hunter takes during its Activation (Standard Move,
  Retreat, Charge, Dash etc.). If it is cast as part of a Charge, it does not need to take the most direct route
  possible, but it still selects the target as normal (Line of Sight, within 12” etc.).
* **Oracle Beast Cloak:** Once per Turn, the Hunter can use this `GOETIC (3)` after an injury is rolled against it to
  negate the result (and any other effects caused by the triggering event) entirely. Effects from the triggering event,
  such as `BLAST` weapons that originally targeted the Hunter, still affect other models as normal.

> of torture to power the Goetic magic of the sorcerers and other users of the dark arts. Captured during one of the hunts
> of the Court, sold to the devils in the heretic domains or having the misfortune to have foolishly pushed through in the
> places where the borders of the world are thin, their minds are scarred by witnessing the horror of damnation while
> still alive. Willing to do anything to escape their fate a million times worse than death, they grasp at the thinnest of
> straws. Should a wretch bring down a mighty opponent, the Law of Hell is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom, in
> memory and honour of the First Rebellion when there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels painted the firmament red.

* **Demonic Aura:** Depending on which Deadly Sin the warband is dedicated to, the Desecrated Saint has one of the
  following auras:
    * **Aura of Sloth:** Enemy models within 8” of the Saint treat Minor Hit results as a Down result instead. This
      affects models that normally treat Down results as a Minor Hit result (such as models wearing Machine Armour).

      melee combat with one of their allies.

      the Saint projects all around it. This includes additional effects, such as Machine Armour’s ability to reduce
      Down results to Minor Hit results, but not penalties or neutral effects (such as the Charging penalty or the base
      size adjustment). Note: Holy Icon Shields and Armour, Infernal Iron Armour or similar armour that always grant
      armour save are not affected by the Aura of Lust.
