# Cult of the Black Grail

> Epidemics of typhus, malaria, typhoid, smallpox, yellow-fever, pneumonia, trench fever, Markisian disease and
> countless others ravage the trenches and battlefields of the Great War, but they all pale in comparison to the most
> dreaded of them all: the Black Grail.
>
> Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, stands apart from the other lords of Hell, who act mainly through their mortal
> followers. Instead, when he periodically gains supremacy in the bitter power struggles of the archfiends, he sends forth
> his deadliest curse.
>
> Infused with demonic essence from the bowels of the seventh layer of Hell, where the putrid fortress of Beelzebub
> stands, spews forth a torrent of demonic hell-flies, scorpions, locusts and other infernal insects. The Hellgate opens
> and a veritable tidal wave of foulness emerges, flowing across the land at startling speed, consuming everything and
> leaving indescribable horror in its wake. After nine days the insect swarm exhausts itself, devouring its own in its
> insatiable hunger.
>
> The Black Grail is indiscriminate in its hatred of all living things: its infections can spread to virtually any
> living biological matter, which bursts forth with tumours, boils and weeping pustules. Puddles and ponds of melted flesh
> are left in its wake, endless mouths left screaming in their agony, for the Black Grail destroys the body but leaves the
> mind intact to suffer. The Scientist-Priests of the Church and the Alchemists of the Sultanate fervently look for a way
> to inoculate their people against this foulest of diseases, but thus far they are without success. The only answer is to
> burn the infected settlements with specially-constructed flamethrower tanks that use holy anointing oil as the fuel for
> their weapons.
>
> But if this is not done, or the countermeasures are too late, what happens next is even worse: bodies of men, horses,
> dogs, insects and other animals of every kind that are infected by the Black Grail lurch to their feet, driven by a
> demonic will. Not living, not dead, they become vessels to spread the corruption of their master ever further, forming
> warbands that strive to find and infect life of any kind. They also gather things that mortals value and bring this loot
> as well as grisly trophies to the feet of the idols of Beelzebub they erect. Thus the Cult of the Black Grail mocks the
> devotions of the Faithful and their prayers.
>
> At the head of such warbands stand the knights of the Order of the Fly: those most depraved men and women who
> willingly embrace the Black Grail and whose devotion Beelzebub finds sufficient. They are granted weapons, armour and
> equipment corrupted by the hand of the Archfiend in exchange for sacrifices brought to the altars of Beelzebub, which
> these warbands build wherever they go, objects of grisly horror constructed from the remains of their victims shaped
> into the form of monstrous flies.

## Black Grail Special Rules

### Infection Markers

Some attacks by the weaponry of the Black Grail causes their opponents to suffer INFECTION MARKERS. These work in a
similar fashion to BLOOD MARKERS. INFECTION MARKERS can be used to modify dice rolls exactly like BLOOD MARKERS (i.e.
ACTION rolls and injury rolls and used in Bloodbaths). Use a different coloured dice (the more disgusting the better!)
to indicate these markers and place them next to the infected model.

A model may have up to six INFECTION MARKERS and six BLOOD MARKERS at the same time. If a model had any INFECTION
MARKERS before, but has none when it is Activated, no new ones are added to the model – though it can still be
re-infected by further attacks if a model has one or more INFECTION MARKERS when activated, it gains \(+1\) INFECTION
MARKER.

### Morale

Fighting against the Black Grail is a terrifying prospect. Enemy Warbands roll Morale Tests with \(-1\) DICE when
fighting a Black Grail Warband. The Court Warbands and other Black Grail Warbands ignore this penalty.

## Warband Creation

You have 700 ducats to recruit your initial Force in the campaign. For one-off battles, we suggest a typical force of
900 ducats and 8 Glory Points.

## Black Grail Armoury

The Cult of the Black Grail can be equipped with the following weapons, armour and equipment. All exceptions are clearly
listed here on the entries for each warrior or in the list below. If any item is marked as `LIMIT`, you can only have as
many of these weapons at any point during the campaign as indicated in the brackets. Armaments marked as `ELITE` only
are limited to the models with that Keyword.

## Black Grail Special Weapons & Equipment

The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Black Grail Warband.

### Infested Rifle

> Armour offers little protection against the horrid, tainted bullets of this rifle, polluted by the power of Beelzebub
> himself. The bullets are semi-sentient, flying through the tiniest of chink in any armour.

| Name           | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Infested Rifle | 2-handed | 18”   | -         | -        |

**Rules:** When resolving injuries for this weapon, the total modifier to injuries from a model’s armour (including
shields) is reduced by 1. Thus Reinforced Armour, for example, only offers a \(-1\) modifier to injury rolls this weapon
causes.

### Corruption Belcher

> Corruption Belchers spew forth noxious gas and corrosive fumes captured from the Bolgias of the putrid swamps of the
> seventh layer of Hell.

| Name               | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:-------------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Corruption Belcher | 2-handed | 8”    | -         | `GAS`    |

**Rules:** This weapon automatically hits and it ignores armour. Because this weapon has the Keyword `GAS`, it inflicts
an additional BLOOD MARKER on a hit.

### Putrid Shotgun

> Loaded with corroded demon-possessed winged shot filled with infected parasite larvae, the rounds of the Putrid
> Shotguns are almost impossible to avoid. This repulsive weapon is nicknamed ‘blunderpus’ by the New Antioch troops.

| Name           | Type     | Range | Modifiers                  | Keywords  |
|:---------------|:---------|:------|:---------------------------|:----------|
| Putrid Shotgun | 2-handed | 12”   | \(+1 \text{D to Attacks}\) | `ASSAULT` |

**Rules:** This weapon rolls attacks with \(+1\) DICE and causes INFECTION MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS.

### Viscera Cannon

> This heavy firearm is the most loathsome and repulsive of all the weapons in the arsenal of the Black Grail - and that
> is saying something, considering the stiff competition it has. A warrior armed with this pride of Beelzebub inserts its
> tubes into their own abdomen and then shoots the corrosive contents of their own innards at the enemy. It is operated by
> a hand crank that first builds pressure inside the user until they are at the point of bursting, and then releases the
> spray of viscera at their foe. The greater the amount of their own flesh the user releases, the more horrific the
> damage.

| Name           | Type     | Range | Modifiers                  | Keywords |
|:---------------|:---------|:------|:---------------------------|:---------|
| Viscera Cannon | 2-handed | 24”   | \(+2 \text{D to Attacks}\) | `HEAVY`  |

**Rules:** This weapon rolls attacks with \(+2\) DICE, as even the slightest splash can kill. After resolving an injury
caused by this weapon, this model may choose to suffer up to three BLOOD MARKERS to inflict the same number of
additional BLOOD MARKERS upon the target of the attack.

### Plague Blade

> Carrying the viral strain of Beelzebub himself, these weapons are the terror of all mortals. Even the tiniest nick or
> scratch usually leads to an agonising death and eternal servitude to the Lord of Flies as a ghastly walking corpse.

| Name         | Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:-------------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| Plague Blade | 1-handed | Melee | -         | -        |

**Rules:** This weapon causes INFECTION MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS.

### Beelzebub’s Axe

> With blades crafted in the form of a fly spreading its wings, this enormous axe is eternally covered with the
> corruption and filth of Beelzebub.

| Name            | Type     | Range | Modifiers                       | Keywords |
|:----------------|:---------|:------|:--------------------------------|:---------|
| Beelzebub’s Axe | 2-handed | Melee | \(+2 \text{D to Injury rolls}\) | `HEAVY`  |

**Rules:** This weapon rolls injuries with \(+2\) DICE, causing INFECTION MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS.

### Black Grail Shield

> The Device of the Black Grail carries the blessing of the Lord of Flies. It has a will of its own, moving to intercept
> any bullets or other projectiles that might impede the work of Beelzebub.

**Rules:** This counts as a Trench Shield. In addition, when this model is targeted by a ranged attack, it can draw on
the power of the Black Grail to disturb the flow of reality as an ACTION. If successful, the ranged attack is rolled
with \(-2\) DICE. If this ACTION is a Critical, the ranged attack automatically misses. This can be done outside of the
model’s Activation and can be done each time the model is targeted by a ranged attack.

### Parasite Grenades

> Gift from the Lord of the Flies, these grenades are filled with parasitic mind worms whose bites cause fever dreams
> and terrifying hallucinations. They are used to force the mortals away from the safety of defended bunkers and trenches.

| Name    | Type    | Range | Modifiers | Keywords  |
|:--------|:--------|:------|:----------|:----------|
| Grenade | GRENADE | 8”    | -         | `ASSAULT` |

**Rules:** If this weapon hits a model, the target is moved up to 3” in a single direction of the attacker’s choosing.
This can be used to move the model out of cover, to fall from a high position or even into Melee Combat with their
enemies. Models that are immune to `FEAR` cannot be moved by this weapon.

### Compound Eyes Helmet

> This ancient helmet fuses itself to its wearer, connecting its nerves into the compound eyes of the helmet, granting
> enhanced vision.

**Rules:** This counts as a Combat Helmet. Additionally, this model increases its Ranged characteristic by \(+1\) DICE.

### Grail Devotee

> Given birth by Matagot Hags after devouring living victims whole, these diminutive thralls are driven by an
> unspeakable thirst for fluids tainted by the Black Grail. They attach themselves to the nobles of the Order of the Fly,
> endlessly begging for any secretion or discharge of fluid their master might be able to spare. Nobles of the Fly pass
> their ammunition and blades through the devotee’s digestive system to enhance the deadliness of their weapons.

**Rules:** A single model may be accompanied by up to two Grail Devotees. For each Devotee a model is accompanied by, it
rolls injuries with a flat \(+1\) bonus with all of its attack ACTIONS. Note that although Grail Devotees can be
represented by a model, they are not treated as models for any rules purposes. As equipment, they must remain stationary
and wholly on the base of the model that they accompany.

## The Order of the Fly

### Noble Hierarchy

When your warband is created, you must choose whether it will be led by a Lord of Tumours or a Plague Knight.

* **Lord of Tumours:** Your warband must include a Lord of Tumours when it is created. Your warband may include up to
  one Lord of Tumours and up to two Plague Knights.
* **Plague Knight:** Your warband must include a Plague Knight when it is created and may include up to three.

### 0-1 Lord of Tumours (130 ducats)

> A high-ranking noble officiant in the Cult of the Black Grail, the Lord of Tumours spreads filth and corruption
> amongst friend and foe alike. They commune with the Lord of the Flies through a trance-like ecstasy and can channel the
> very power of the seventh circle of Hell which Beelzebub rules.

| Name            | Movement    | Ranged              | Melee               | Armour | Base    |
|:----------------|:------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------|:--------|
| Lord of Tumours | 6”/Infantry | \(+1 \text{ DICE}\) | \(+4 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 40/50mm |

**Equipment:** A Lord of Tumours can be equipped with any weapon, armour and equipment from the Black Grail Armoury.

**Abilities:**

* **Beelzebub’s Touch:** If a melee attack by the Lord of Tumours hits the target and causes at least one BLOOD MARKER
  or INFECTION MARKER, the Lord of Tumours inflicts an additional INFECTION MARKER on the target. Additionally, the Lord
  of Tumours is never considered unarmed and any of its empty hands count as Trench Clubs.
* **Undead Fortitude:** Non-`FIRE` injuries against the Lord of Tumours are rolled with \(-1\) DICE. Additionally, this
  model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Tough:** The Lord of Tumours is extremely difficult to bring down with conventional weapons. It is subject to the
  rules for `TOUGH` Creatures.
* **Fear:** The Lord of Tumours is unspeakably terrifying in its putrid and bubonic glory and therefore causes `FEAR`.
* **Strong:** The Lord of Tumours ignores the effect of the Keyword `HEAVY` on any weapon they wield.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `ELITE`, `TOUGH`, `STRONG`, `FEAR`, `LEADER`

### 0-2 Plague Knight (60 Ducats)

> Ranking lowliest in the nobility of the Black Grail, these armoured great warriors were once truly depraved
> worshippers Beelzebub. When the Black Grail came for them, they willingly submitted themselves to the authority of the
> Lord of Flies. As a result they retain a semblance of sentience and the ability to wield weapons as they did in life.
> They aspire to win favour in the eyes of Beelzebub and one day be promoted in the hierarchy of the Order of the Fly.

| Name          | Movement    | Ranged | Melee               | Armour | Base |
|:--------------|:------------|:-------|:--------------------|:-------|:-----|
| Plague Knight | 6”/Infantry | \(+0\) | \(+2 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 32mm |

**Equipment:** A Plague Knight cannot be fielded, unless it is equipped with a suit of armour. In addition, a Plague
Knight can be equipped with any weapon, armour and equipment from the Black Grail Armoury.

**Plague Knight Ranks:** You may have one rank per Plague Knight if you pay the necessary cost, as indicated:

* **Knight Companion of the Fly:** Add \(+1\) DICE to Ranged or Melee. Costs \(+5\) ducats.
* **Knight of the Rotten Cross:** When acquired, this model may purchase any weapon from the New Antioch or Heretic
  Legion list. The Knight of the Rotten Cross cannot give its weapon away but can purchase a new one if the old one is
  lost. Costs \(+5\) ducats.
* **Plague Almoner:** This model requires one less BLOOD MARKER/INFECTION MARKER to cause Bloodbath. Costs \(+10\)
  ducats.

**Abilities:**

* **Undead Fortitude:** Non-`FIRE` injuries against the Plague Knight are rolled with \(-1\) DICE. Additionally, this
  model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Fear:** Plague Knights are unnatural, horrifying creatures and as such cause `FEAR`.
* **Strong:** Ignores the effect of the Keyword `HEAVY` on any weapon they wield.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `ELITE`, `FEAR`, `STRONG`

### 0-3 Corpse Guard (55 Ducats)

> Only the strongest human devotees can survive the blessings of the Black Grail. The ones that do are inducted into the
> ranks of the Corpse Guard, bodyguards to the nobility of the Black Grail. If they serve with distinction, they may one
> day join the ranks of the Infernal Nobility.

| Name         | Movement    | Ranged | Melee               | Armour | Base |
|:-------------|:------------|:-------|:--------------------|:-------|:-----|
| Corpse Guard | 6”/Infantry | \(+0\) | \(+1 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 32mm |

**Equipment:** Corpse Guard can be equipped with any weapon, armour and equipment from the Black Grail Armoury.

**Abilities:**

* **Parasitic Tick:** If the Corpse Guard inflicts one or more BLOOD or INFECTION MARKERS with a melee attack on a non-
  `BLACK GRAIL` model, it can remove one of its own BLOOD or INFECTION MARKERS.
* **Bodyguard:** If a `BLACK GRAIL` model within 1” of the Corpse Guard is hit, the Corpse Guard can redirect the hit to
  itself. The injury and any additional effects of the attack are resolved against the Corpse Guard instead of the
  original target. This ability cannot be used against `BLAST` weapons.
* **Undead Fortitude:** Non-`FIRE` injuries against the Corpse Guard are rolled with \(-1\) DICE. Additionally, this
  model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Fear:** Corpse Guard are unnatural, horrifying creature and as such cause `FEAR`.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `ELITE`, `FEAR`

## Servants of the Black Grail

### 0-3 Hounds of the Black Grail (55 ducats)

> Parasitic carcasses of canines infested with maggots and flies spawned from the body of Beelzebub himself. Their
> unholy mission is to prowl No Man’s Land and spread diseases and pestilence in the name of their dark master.

| Name  | Movement    | Ranged | Melee               | Armour | Base      |
|:------|:------------|:-------|:--------------------|:-------|:----------|
| Hound | 8”/Infantry | N/A    | \(+1 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 30 x 60mm |

fighting unarmed. At the cost of \(+5\) ducats, they cause INFECTION MARKERS with their unarmed attacks instead of BLOOD
MARKERS.

  ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Frightening Speed:** Hounds roll to Dash with \(+1\) DICE and they do not suffer any penalties to movement after
  they Stand from being Down.
* **Disease Carrier:** If an enemy model is Activated while in Melee Combat with a Hound, that model suffers one
  INFECTION MARKER.
* **Fear:** Hounds are unnatural and horrifying creatures and therefore cause `FEAR`.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `FEAR`

### Grail Thrall/Fly Thrall (25 ducats)

> The boons of the Black Grail lead slowly but surely down the path of utter corruption. Only very few of the chosen can
> withstand the blessings of the Lord of the Flies. Most are turned into Grail Thralls, and join the endless legions of
> empty, hollowed-out and diseased husks who must obey the whims of the Black Grail nobles for all eternity, while
> suffering the torment of their countless supernatural infections.
>
> Thralls come in two varieties: Grail Thralls that have become almost impervious to pain and Fly Thralls, controlled by
> the gargantuan hell-flies that have buried their proboscis deep into the central nervous system of their victims,
> allowing far greater mobility in exchange for less resistance to pain.

| Name         | Movement    | Ranged | Melee               | Armour | Base |
|:-------------|:------------|:-------|:--------------------|:-------|:-----|
| Grail Thrall | 5”/Infantry | N/A    | \(-1 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 25mm |
| Fly Thrall   | 6”/Flying   | N/A    | \(-1 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 25mm |

**Equipment:** Thralls cannot be equipped with any weapons, armour or equipment. They do not suffer penalties for
fighting unarmed.

**Abilities:**

* **Overwhelming Horde:** For each friendly `BLACK GRAIL` model within 3” of the Thrall, it gains \(+1\) DICE to its
  Melee attack rolls, up to maximum \(+4\) DICE.
* **Undead Fortitude:** Non-`FIRE` injuries against the Grail Thrall (but not Fly Thrall) are rolled with \(-1\) DICE.
  Additionally, this model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Fear:** Thralls are unnatural and horrifying creatures and therefore cause `FEAR`.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `FEAR`

### 0-4 Heralds of Beelzebub (50 ducats)

> Some victims of the Black Grail suffer a far worse fate than becoming a Thrall. They are bestowed with the black
> honour by being melded with hell-flies, growing into a grotesque winged insect made of bloated flesh. After this
> torturous metamorphosis they take to air as Heralds of Beelzebub, the winged squires and scouts of the Order of the Fly.
> Their vestigial human bodies are still conscious as they are slowly eaten from within to be used as fuel by the Herald,
> all the while their warped bodies fight for the glory of Hell against their will.
>
> The Heralds are the vanguard in any assault of the Black Grail, and the ear-numbing otherworldly drone of their wings
> strikes terror in any defender, breaking their focus and sapping their willpower. Heralds wield discarded weapons,
> contaminated with horrible worms that churn through them, which in turn infect their victims. Each diseased bullet has
> sentience of its own, finding even the smallest chink in any armour, burrowing into the nervous system and liquefying
> the internal organs from within.

| Name   | Movement   | Ranged              | Melee               | Armour | Base |
|:-------|:-----------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------|:-----|
| Herald | 10”/Flying | \(+0 \text{ DICE}\) | \(+0 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 40mm |

**Equipment:** Heralds can be equipped with any ranged weapon from the Black Grail Armoury. They cannot be equipped with
any other items, except for Compound Eyes Helmets or a single Grail Devotee. When they fight unarmed in Melee Combat,
the attack is always modified by Infected Proboscis. One Herald can have the Maddening Buzz ability (see below) at the
cost of \(+10\) ducats.

**Abilities:**

* **Infected Proboscis:** Heralds do not suffer penalties for fighting unarmed, and they cause INFECTION MARKERS with
  their unarmed attacks instead of BLOOD MARKERS. If this attack inflicts an INFECTION MARKER on a non-`BLACK GRAIL`
  enemy model, the Herald can remove one of their own BLOOD MARKERS.
* **Maddening Buzz (+10 ducats):** Every ACTION taken by non-`BLACK GRAIL` models within 8” of a Herald is considered a
  RISKY ACTION. Note: This does not affect non-ACTION rolls such as Charge distance rolls, nor does it affect ACTIONS
  that do not require a roll on the Action Success Chart.
* **Toxic:** This model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Skirmisher:** Heralds are fast and elusive, and thus have the Keyword `SKIRMISHER`. `SKIRMISHER`S can move D3” when
  they are targeted by or would intercept a Charge, unless they are in Melee Combat or they are Down. This helps them
  keep out of reach of close-range threats.
* **Fear:** Heralds are unnatural and repulsive creatures and therefore cause `FEAR`.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `FEAR`, `SKIRMISHER`

### 0-1 Amalgam (140 Ducats)

> An Amalgam is a huge, shambling mass of dozens of bodies of infected fallen enemy warriors, insects, mammals and any
> other living creatures that had the misfortune of succumbing to the agonising blessings of the Black Grail together.
> These shoggoths shamble across the battlefield like walking mountains of corpulent, diseased flesh, its flailing arms

| Name    | Movement    | Ranged              | Melee               | Armour | Base |
|:--------|:------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------|:-----|
| Amalgam | 6”/Infantry | \(+0 \text{ DICE}\) | \(+0 \text{ DICE}\) | 0      | 60mm |

**Equipment:** The amalgam has six functional arms. They can carry six one-handed weapons or three double-handed
weapons, or any combination thereof, as long as the six arms can carry them. The amalgam uses the Black Grail Armoury
for weapons – it never carries any other gear except weapons, though one of its arms may carry a single trench shield (
representing pieces of armour it has absorbed). It may not carry Grenades and it can only wield up to two weapons with
the same name. The Amalgam can take a Ranged Attack ACTION once per Activation with each ranged weapon it is equipped
with and it can take a Melee Attack ACTION once per Activation with each melee weapon it is equipped with. None of its
weapons are off-hand weapons. The Amalgam cannot benefit from Shield Combo.

**Abilities:**

* **Corpulent:** An Amalgam is a vast bulk of diseased flesh and is extraordinarily difficult to kill. Injuries against
  the Amalgam are rolled with \(-2\) DICE.
* **Tough:** The Amalgam is extremely difficult to bring down with conventional weapons. It is subject to the rules for
  `TOUGH` Creatures.
* **Toxic:** This model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword `GAS`.
* **Trample:** Once during its Activation, the Amalgam may make an extra Melee Attack ACTION against a Downed enemy
  model on a 32mm or smaller base. Resolve the attack as if the Amalgam was armed with a Trench Club. This attack
  ignores armour as the Amalgam stomps their enemies into pulp.
* **Unstoppable:** Enemy models never get free attacks against the Amalgam when it Retreats. Additionally, the Amalgam
  can move out of Melee Combat using its Standard Move, Charge and Dash.
* **Fear:** Amalgam is a mountain of morbid, murderous flesh and therefore causes `FEAR`.
* **Strong:** Two of the arms of the Amalgam have the Keyword `STRONG`. It can wield any two `HEAVY` weapons of its
  choice, each using one hand regardless of the weapon rules.

**Keywords:** `BLACK GRAIL`, `FEAR`, `TOUGH`, `STRONG`

# Warband Variant: Dirge of the Great Hegemon

> In the annals of the Great War two mighty Hegemons of the Black Grail have risen: Yersinia Rex, Emperor of Pestilence,
> and Febris, the rotting Bride of Beelzebub. Each of them were destroyed, but at an unimaginable cost to the forces of
> the Great Tyrant YHWH. Even the great Paladin Engelier, the Sword of Heaven, died when confronting the might of a
> Hegemon.
>
> With the ascension of a Hegemon, the hideous power of the Black Grail is exalted. Beelzebub grows sleek and fat, and
> like a magnanimous king, bestowing blessings and gifts upon his most favoured children. Beelzebub’s insidious grip over
> his Grail Thralls greatly increases. They move with more grace and the exalted blessings of the Grail opens their ruined
> minds, allowing them to truly witness the rotting glory of the Lord of the Flies, enabling them to understand more
> complex weaponry. In turn, the nobles that make up the ranks of the Order of the Fly are given kingly gifts from their
> mighty liege.
>
> Full of the ascendant power of the Black Grail, how miserable they become when their Hegemon lord falls in battle.
> Each Hegemon is unique, and when slain, it can never be re-created. The ecstasy of the Plague Knights in the service of
> their dread ruler sinks into the deepest despair from which there is no escape. Their strain of the Black Grail is
> shunned by others of their kind and they are no longer welcome at Ekron, the City of Beelzebub: they are cast out from
> the Order of the Fly for their failure. The Hegemon’s strain of disease continues spreading and creating thralls, but
> they are born into a world bereft of their sires, leaving them hopeless and desolated.
>
> The eyes of the Plague Knights continuously weep cold black blood as they cry for their lost Dark Paradise that will
> never be again. The tantalising dream of a great flood of pestilence that cleanses the earth is lost forever. Their
> mournful wails echo and reverberate through No Man’s Land, a cry of sorrow deeper than any mortal can feel, and
> agonising rage of black hatred that no mortal comprehends. They compose mournful paeans to their lost Hegemon -beautiful
> yet disturbing songs that promise nothing but never-ending death.
>
> Such shattered remains of the once-mighty legions of the Hegemon take their vengeance on any opponent regardless of
> their allegiance, even throwing themselves at other Black Grail warbands in futile acts of regret, trying to feel pain
> that would at least momentarily dull their aching feeling of loss. But no such hope exists in their eternal damnation.
>
> These bands made up of the strains of fallen Hegemons’ once-mighty legions form everlasting funeral processions for
> their dead masters. The echo of their dirges accompanies their solemn steps, taking them from nowhere to nowhere. Their
> eyes are forever stained by the foul tears of the Black Grail and their skin turns black and sloughs off, hanging in
> tatters like funereal garb. They seek lost artefacts and broken shards of armour and weapons of their lost liege,
> fashioning disturbing and rusted jewellery from these remains where the Hegemon’s power still lingers beyond the grave.
> Few things that haunt No Man’s Land are more dangerous – or ghastlier – than these corruption-ridden echoes of the dark
> past, the funeral processions that last until time itself is no more.

### The Dirge Special Rules

The warband has the following special rules:

* **The Executor:** The warband must include an Executor (use Plague Knight characteristics) who has the Keyword `TOUGH`
  and a Ranged characteristic of \(+1\) DICE. The Executor costs 80 ducats.
* **The Lamenters:** The warband can include up to three Plague Knights (including the Executor) known as The Lamenters.
* **The Fallen:** The warband cannot include a Lord of Tumours or Amalgam, for all were slain a long time ago.
* **The Lost:** The warband may only include a maximum of two Hounds (known as Wailers) and a maximum of two Heralds of
  Beelzebub (called Weepers).
* **The Bereaved:** The Grail Thralls and Fly Thralls of the warband are called the Bereaved. Bereaved have a Ranged
  characteristic of \(+0\) DICE and cost 30 ducats each. Grail Thralls (but not Fly Thralls) can be equipped with ranged
  weapons, standards and musical instruments from the Black Grail Armoury.
* **Dishonoured:** No model in the warband may carry a Black Grail Shield or Beelzebub’s Axe. The Lord of the Flies does
  not suffer failed knights to carry his device.
* **Hegemon’s Last Blessing:** This warband has Plague Blade `LIMIT: 3`, Putrid Shotgun `LIMIT: 3` and Viscera Cannon
  `LIMIT: 3`. Non-`ELITE` models can be equipped with Viscera Cannons.

### Hegemon’s Will

Using the remnants of the lingering power of a fallen Hegemon, a Plague Knight of the Warband can directly command a
nearby Thrall.

During its Activation, a Plague Knight in this warband can remove an INFECTION MARKER from any model in play to enable a
friendly Thrall within 18” to use any one of the Actions detailed below. Each Thrall can only be affected by Hegemon’s
Will once per Turn, but one Plague Knight may issue commands to multiple Thralls (though not multiple commands to the
same Thrall) during a single Activation, if all the conditions are met.

* **Move:** The Thrall takes a standard Move ACTION.
* **Ranged Attack:** The Thrall takes a Ranged Attack ACTION with any Ranged weapon it has.
* **Charge:** The Thrall takes a standard Charge ACTION.
* **Melee Attack:** The Thrall takes a Melee Attack ACTION.
