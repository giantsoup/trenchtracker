# Principality of New Antioch

> For three hundred years the Principality of New Antioch has stood defiantly as the focal point of the Church and the
> Faithful at the very edge of the shadow cast by the Gate of Hell. It is the Home of All Our Hopes, the bulwark against
> Heretic forces and the first line of defence against the devil’s might. Should New Antioch fall, the Levant will be lost
> and the path to heartlands of the Church will be wide open.
>
> More than anything else, it is the volunteers who come to serve under the Banner of Christ that ensure the continuous
> existence of the Principality. Thus in the streets of the city one can hear hundreds of languages and dialects. One
> might observe hussars of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth brushing shoulders with the last remnants of the Varangian
> Guard, or hear the sermons of a street preacher from Eire extolling the soldiery of Ethiopia to lay down their lives for
> the holy cause.

## Faction Lore

War has never left this corner of the world. The ancient city of Antioch was destroyed by a mysterious demonic weapon in
the year 1545, but the Faithful never gave up their positions in the ruins. Despite the lethal demonic essence emanating
from the crater that was left behind, the garrison held on, even as mighty Constantinople fell to the legions of
Kimaris, Marquis of Hell.

In the year 1559 the Sword Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify the city, and that a yearly tithe is to be
sent to New Antioch by all the Faithful nations. Instead of coin, endless supply trains of foodstuffs, tools,
ammunition, weaponry, machinery and skilled workers and engineers come from across Europa and the Mediterranean Sea, as
well as the African dominions.

Since those days New Antioch has grown to be the most important fortress-city in the world, the Sword and the Shield of
Europa and Africa. To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their
seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle
shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a vigilant watch day and night.

As the nominal supreme commander of all the Faithful armed forces, the Duke of New Antioch is a title of unrivalled
prestige and honour. But despite swearing fealty to the Duke, in reality most of the troops from across all of
Christendom who come to do battle against Hell operate in units of their own, taking commands from their leaders and
making their own strategic decisions.

Still, some soldiers do indeed renounce their citizenship and take up the cross, and come to serve under Duke
Constantine alone. Thus the standing army of the Principality is the greatest single fighting force the Faithful can
muster.

In recent years the Duke has despatched small warbands into No Man’s Land to gather intelligence, look for artefacts of
power, conduct raids on Heretic forces, secure strategic strongpoints and loot the battlefields. These warbands are
simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics,
great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are
willing to risk all in the crucible of war.

### Oath of New Antioch

> “I swear to serve faithfully, loyally and honourably the reigning Duke and Duchess of New Antioch, and their
> legitimate successors, to devote myself to them with all my strength, sacrificing even my life in their defence.
>
> I assume the same duties towards the Princes of the Church and the city of New Antioch itself, for she is the Home of
> All Our Hopes. I shall make war against the Heretics without cessation and without mercy.
>
> I also promise my Commander and the other Superiors respect, fidelity and obedience. Thus I swear, may God and our
> Holy Patrons assist me.”
>
> **Response of the guards to the Flag of New Antioch:**
> “I swear to faithfully, loyally and honourably observe all that is read to me at this time. May God and our Holy
> Patrons assist me!”

## Faction Rules

### New Antioch Fireteams

Your warband may have up to two **Fireteams**. These Fireteams may consist of any two models from your warband. Models
in Fireteams gain the Keyword **FIRETEAM**.

* **FIRETEAM**: This model is part of a **FIRETEAM** made up of two models. All models that are part of the same *
  *FIRETEAM** can be activated at the same time without the opponent getting their turn in between and can take their *
  *ACTIONS** in any order they wish, switching between the two models. Note that if the Activation of either member of
  the **FIRETEAM** forcefully ends (due to a failed **RISKY ACTION** for example), it ends both Activations. Allies
  cannot be part of a **FIRETEAM**.
* **Concentrated Attack**: If a model in the **FIRETEAM** makes any kind of Attack **ACTION** (ranged or melee) against
  an opponent, where the other member of their **FIRETEAM** has already hit it with an attack **ACTION** during the same
  activation, the cost of a Bloodbath is reduced to three **BLOOD MARKERS** against this opponent, whether the model is
  standing or Down.

## Warband Creation

* **Campaign**: You have **700 ducats** to recruit your initial Force.
* **One-off Battles**: We suggest a typical force of **900 ducats** and **8 Glory Points**.

## Equipment List

*All exceptions are clearly listed on the entries for each warrior.*
