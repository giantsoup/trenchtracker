Trench Pilgrims
“A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no
sign shall be given unto it, but the
sign of the meta-christ.” A - Divinations 12:9
s the war rages against the minions of
Hell, strange visions torment the faithful
across the globe. Men and women touched
by Heaven are granted visions and
Revelations are made by the messengers of
God. Sisters of the Holy Orders are marked by Stigmata
and take up the sword and the cross as instructed by
angels. Those who have transgressed seek to atone for
their sins by taking as many followers of the Devil with
them to the afterlife.
So they come, the mad and the maimed, the Godtouched and the guilt-ridden – all gathering around
Prophets and Prophetesses, forming Trench Pilgrim
Processions. These disorganised groups arm themselves
and follow the prophets of the Lord unto the front
lines. They fight with unrivalled zeal, hurling themselves
against the Heretics, arming themselves with anything
they can get their hands on from the oldest muskets to
scourges and Molotov Cocktails.
Pilgrims are not officially sanctioned by the Holy
See of New Antioch, but the Church still blesses the
crusades of the faithful. Thus the Pilgrim Processions
are a common sight on the battlefields, often
crossing No Man’s Land in suicidal assaults upon the
Heretics, directed by the visions of their Prophets and
Prophetesses who lead them, urged on by the whips of
Castigators who are charged with instilling the Fear of
God in their troops.
The bulk of the Pilgrims are men and women with
little military training, but when they don the Iron
Capirote of a Trench Pilgrim, they can face even a
demon from the deepest Bolgias of Hell unflinchingly.
Nor is death necessarily an end to their mission:
sometimes the Seventh Meta-Christ will deem a
fallen pilgrim worthy and bring them back as MartyrPenitents: warriors half-way between Heaven and Earth,
able to fight once more and feel no pain from bullet or
bayonet thrust.
Rarer and more dangerous are the Stigmatic Nuns,
Holy Sisters who manifest wounds to match those of the
Third Meta-Christ whom they venerate. They excel in
close quarter combat, for each bleeding wound that they
suffer makes them stronger, not weaker, as their devotion
to suffering as their Lord once did gives them strength
and endurance not found in common mortals. Armed
with swords and pistols, they cross No Man’s Land
heedless of any danger, praying to sustain wounds for the
Redeemer which in turn will transform them into the
very Vengeance of the Lord.
In front of the Trench Pilgrims are driven the
Ecclesiastic Prisoners – either captured enemies of the
True Faith or volunteer sinners. Each is strapped with a
high explosive which is detonated once they reach enemy
lines. They dash across the killing grounds, hoping to
somehow survive the blast and escape, or take as many
followers of Lucifer with them as they can, depending on
their convictions.
The most puissant of Pilgrim Processions will be
accompanied by a Shrine Anchorite, a metal behemoth
some twelve feet tall, a living altar of war almost
completely immune to any damage. The interior of the
Anchorite is covered in spikes and barbed hooks so that
the monk pilot is in a constant state of torment, rejoicing
in their pain so they can suffer as their Lord once did.
In combat they wield Adamantine Catherine Wheels of
massive proportions which they use to crush sinners and
heretics into a pulp, stringing them upon the wheel as a
warning to others.
There are a bewildering number and variety of Trench
Pilgrim Processions: The Path of Pious Revenge swears
in the name of St. Olga and uses flamethrowers, burning
grenades and incendiary ammunition to assail the
Heretics. The Pilgrims of the Iron Path follow St. Rita
of Cascia and go to battle with hammers, mauls, maces
and cudgels, and hammer nails into their heads in the
memory of the saint they venerate. The Theban Legion
of Rome carries the heads of the heretics upon their
standards in the memory of their patron, St. Marice.
They fight with swords and other blades, competing with
each other for the number of heretic heads they amass.

Trench Pilgrims Special Equipment
The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Trench Pilgrim warband.
Iron Capirote
A conical helmet reminiscent of the headgear of the penitents. Blessed by the Church and often containing a fragment of a
relic, Iron Capirotes shield their wearers from the psychological horror of war, enabling them to face creatures from the pits of
Hell unflinchingly.
Rules: Negates the additional BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with Keyword SHRAPNEL. Makes the model immune
to the effects of FEAR.
Molotov Cocktail
Developed on the desperate Finnish battle frontier against the Ice Demons, this improvised weapon consists of a glass bottle
containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture plus a source of ignition.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Molotov GRENADE 6” -1D to Injury FIRE, ASSAULT
Rules: -1 DICE on injury rolls. Molotov Cocktails ignore all penalties for terrain/cover, as well as ignoring all armour
on a Critical Attack roll.
War Cross
A War Cross (also known as a wurfkreuz in the Holy Roman Empire) is a four-pronged throwing weapon in the shape of a
cross. It is engraved with prayers and psalms that guide it on an unerring path.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
War Cross - 8” No long-range penalty ASSAULT
Rules: Does not count as one of the Ranged weapons carried by the model. Cannot be carried with Grenades. Ignores
penalties for long range. A model with the weapon will not run out of them.
Punt Gun
A Punt Gun is an enormous shotgun loaded with up to 25 ounces of shot. It can be loaded with a risky amount of powder
and square shot which causes widespread damage and destruction. It is a very popular weapon among Trench Pilgrims who
lack access to conventional heavy weapons.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Punt Gun 2-handed 18” +1D to hit and to injure HEAVY, SHRAPNEL
Rules: Owing to its high accuracy and lethal shot, a punt pun adds +1 DICE to all rolls to hit and to injury rolls.
Before a model shoots with the punt gun, you can overcharge it with a shot, giving the weapon BLAST 3” radius. If
you do this, the shooting ACTION with the Punt Gun always ends the shooter’s Activation and causes one BLOOD
MARKER on the shooter. A model cannot make a ranged attack with the punt gun unless it is either STRONG or
another friendly model is in base contact with it.
Anti-tank Hammer
A polearm with a directional explosive mounted on its head. It is exceedingly good at taking out armoured targets but puts
its user in grave danger.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Anti-Tank Hammer 2-handed Melee +1D to Injuries RISKY, CRITICAL
Rules: Ignores armour modifiers and rolls injuries with +1 DICE. If it hits the enemy, the wielder suffers +1 BLOOD

Your warband must include a War Prophet when it is created.
A charismatic leader and powerful fighter of the Pilgrim group. They are driven by visions of
Armageddon, and their preaching and prophecies drive the pilgrimage from one battlefield to
the next, as they seek to thwart the forces of Satan and find martyrdom in combat.

Abilities
; Loudspeakers: The War Prophet blares out holy sermons and dire prophecies
at 100 decibels to inspire the faithful. The Prophet can take a RISKY ACTION
with +2 DICE once during each Activation. If the action is successful, all friendly
models within 8” of the Prophet (including the Prophet) that are not engaged in
melee can immediately move up to 3” towards any enemy model they can see by
the optimal path that reduces the distance between the moving model and the
enemy. This move allows them to enter combat as if they charged the enemy and
are considered to have done so until the end of the turn.
; Memento Mori: The War Prophet is touched by a higher power and the
revealed truth allows them a degree of protection against premature death. Once
per battle, when the War Prophet is taken Out of Action for any reason, ignore the
result as if nothing had happened.
; Laying on Hands: With a successful ACTION, you may remove D3 BLOOD
MARKERs from any friendly model within 6” (including the Prophet).

  0-1 Shrine Anchorite (Cost: 140 Ducats)
  A colossal suit of machine armour fuelled by diesel and faith, the Shrine Anchorite stands
  as a grim symbol of humanity’s despair. Within its spiked, blood-stained interior, the pilotmonk endures a terrible form of penance, his anguished prayers and chants echoing across
  the battlefield. This grotesque amalgamation of suffering and devotion instils fear in the
  heart of the heretic, as the anchorite, a malevolent weapon draped in holy iconography and
  weeping gore, emerges to unleash a symphony of slaughter, where the wretched union of
  man and machine heralds the demise of all who oppose the Almighty.
  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base
  Anchorite 6”/Infantry N/A +2 Dice -3 60mm
  Equipment
  You cannot buy additional equipment, weapons or armour for Shrine Anchorites. Each
  Anchorite is equipped with a special suit of armour (reflected in the profile), a Combat
  Helmet, a Catherine Wheel and a Bonebreaker Mace. These pieces of equipment are
  built into the integrity of its construction and cannot be removed or lost in any way.
  The weapons are detailed below. The Anchorite may make one attack ACTION with
  each of these weapons in Melee Combat and may make no other attacks during its
  Activation (so it can make two attacks per Activation).
  ; Catherine Wheel: The Anchorite treats the Catherine Wheel as a one-handed
  melee weapon with the Keywords RISKY and HEAVY that grants a +1 DICE
  bonus to hit (for a total of +3 DICE due to its Melee Characteristic). Because of
  the enormous weight and the skill of the Anchorite Shrine in inflicting maximum
  pain, the Catherine Wheel rolls on the Injury Chart with 3D6 (instead of usual
  2D6), adding all three dice together!
  ; Bonebreaker Mace: The Anchorite treats the Bonebreaker Mace as a onehanded melee weapon with the Keyword RISKY. The Bonebreaker Mace has a
  +1 DICE bonus to injure. Because the Mace is wielded alongside the Catherine
  Wheel, it is treated as an Off-Hand Weapon and suffers penalties accordingly.
  Abilities
  ; Tough: The Shrine Anchorite is a huge, hulking mound of metal and is subject
  to the rules for TOUGH creatures.
  ; Fear: The Anchorite causes FEAR.
  ; Broken on the Wheel: Before the start of the battle, one Trench Pilgrim or
  Ecclesiastic Prisoner may voluntarily be broken on the wheel to show their piety
  and devotion (permanently remove all weapons, armour and equipment from the
  victim and use/store them as you wish). The Anchorite will then shatter the bones
  of the volunteer and carry the broken victim to the battle on its Wheel. As long
  as the volunteer is not taken Out of Action, any Attacks against the Anchorite
  are redirected to the volunteer. The volunteer cannot be independently targeted
  by any abilities or attacks (including BLAST weapons). For all rules purposes and
  attack effects (such as forced movement), the two models are treated as a single
  model, including sharing BLOOD, INFECTION and BLESSING MARKERS. Treat
  Down results against the volunteer as a Minor Hit. The volunteer cannot take any
  ACTIONS, be Activated separately or move – for obvious reasons. At the end of
  the battle, even if the volunteer may have survived, the model dies and is removed
  from your warband.

  Affliction
  Trench Pilgrims of the Procession of the Sacred
  Affliction are known for their zeal in close quarter
  combat, their armour decorated with icons and shields
  adorned with the depictions of the Saints, which despite
  appearances can withstand machine gun bullets. The
  millstones they carry upon their backs are used to tie
  about the necks of sinners before drowning them in the
  mud and blood of No Man’s Land. They spurn the use
  of the Iron Capirotes, believing firmly that faith alone is
  enough to withstand the horrors of Hell.
  Special Rules
  ; Face thy Fears: No model in the Procession of
  the Sacred Affliction can wear Iron Capirotes. Those
  troops with Capirotes in their base profile will not
  have them, though their cost remains the same.

  Holy Icon Armour 30 ducats
  This suit of armour is made of blessed icons and scripture
  scrolls written with the blood of saints. This armour

  applies even against attacks that ignore Armour. Can be
  combined with a shield, including Holy Icon Shield.
  Warband Variant:
  Cavalcade of the Tenth
  Plague
  This Trench Pilgrim Procession traditionally sacrifices
  lambs before battle, anointing themselves in its blood
  to ward off the wrath of God. The Pilgrims then draw
  holy symbols with the blood of the sacrifice upon their
  bodies, clothing and armour, and then march to battle
  singing hymns, in certain belief that the blood of the
  Lamb shields them from any harm.
  Firm believers in traditional reading of the Holy Texts,
  they reject the new doctrines of the Meta-Christ by
  the Church. They steal Communicants from other
  Processions and force them to fight for them in penance
  for being born from Sin.
  Special Rules
  ; Blood Sacrifice: Any model (except Ecclesiastic
  Prisoners who are not worthy) in the warband can
  purchase a Sacrificial Lamb (see below).
  ; Heaven Awaits: The Cavalcade rejects the
  doctrine of the Meta-Christ. Their dead Pilgrims
  cannot be resurrected as Martyr-Penitents.
  ; The Unclean: The Cavalcade detests using the
  unclean Ecclesiastic Prisoners and may have only up
  to two of them.
  ; Day of his Wrath: The War Prophet of this
  warband cannot use Laying on Hands but can call
  upon the Wrath of God instead. This is a RISKY
  ACTION. If successful, roll on the Injury Chart
  against one enemy model within 3” of the Prophet.
  Armour offers no protection against this attack.
  ; Stolen Communicants: Communicants cost
  3 Glory Points instead of ducats for this warband
  due to the difficulty of acquiring and indoctrinating
  them.
  ; Favour of the Lord: At the start of each turn,
  you can give any one model in the warband a
  BLESSING MARKER.

  Warband Variant: War
  Pilgrimage of
  Saint Methodius
  From the Night of Fire and Blood that laid low the
  Greater Moravian monastery of Velehrad emerged a
  single monk of the Orthodox Order of St. Methodius.
  Though the rest of the brotherhood perished in the
  catastrophe, slaughtered by a squadron of ruthless Death
  Commandos, the sole survivor brought with him the
  books of the Saint and his faith out of the ruin.
  With the loss of the workshops and monastic libraries
  of Velehrad, it was believed that the secrets of the
  Anchorite construction were lost, especially since the
  Church no longer wished to pursue their construction
  due to advances in armour technology elsewhere. But
  this was in error. The monk, named brother Akakios,
  still knew the craft.
  Akakios fled to the Theocratia of Hellas and founded
  a new monastery on the slopes of holy Mount Athos.
  Many monks lived in the monastic communities on
  the slopes of the mountain and some were attracted to
  join their brother. Thus Akakios became the first War
  Prophet of the Order and many lay members joined or
  became supporters and, eventually, the foot soldiers of
  the well-equipped and disciplined War Pilgrimages of
  St. Methodius. No other Pilgrim Progression can match
  the methodical and technical approach of the soldiers of
  the Order.
  In their fortified monastery the learned monks hoard
  and protect the knowledge of modifying the sacred
  designs of St. Methodius. Their Shrine Anchorites are
  without a peer and feature many modern weapons and
  adjustments which allow them to carry modern longrange weaponry. No other warband has such abundant
  access to Anchorites or the variety of sophisticated
  weaponry and equipment.
  Following the ancient Orthodox creed, the pilgrims
  of St. Methodius reject many of the teachings and
  customs of other Pilgrim Processions. They consider the
  creation of the Communicants as a dangerous heresy and
  condemn the use of Martyrdom Devices as an affront to
  God’s commandment against suicide, as well as holding
  to other beliefs many of the Trench Pilgrims view as
  an essential part of their crusade against the forces of
  Inferno. Bitter schisms and arguments with other sects
  sometimes erupt into violence, and the Church itself
  accuses the Order of Hetrodoxy of clinging to the
  outdated Eastern Orthodox faith.
  However, due to their formidable fortress monasteries
  upon Mount Athos and their undeniable zeal on the
  battlefield, the Princes of the Church turn a blind eye to
  the affairs of the followers of St. Methodius, as long as
  they focus all their zeal in the seemingly impossible task
  of relieving the city of Trebizond. Here, according to
  the visions of prophet Akakios, the unsullied faith is still
  practiced and the Salvation of Mankind will be achieved.
  To this end, the Order sends one War Pilgrimage after
  another to the front line. Not one has made it within
  sight of the fabled walls of Trebizond, but this only
  increases the zeal of the Order and rouses them into ever
  greater efforts to reach the City of the Hill.
  Special Rules
  ; Anchorite Cloister: This warband may buy up to
  two Anchorite Shrines.
  ; Anchorite Armoury: This warband may alter
  the weaponry and equipment of their Anchorites as
  indicated below. Anchorites of St. Methodius have
  +0 DICE to their Ranged Characteristic.
  ; Mortal Sin: No Ecclesiastic Prisoner of the
  warband may be equipped with a Martyrdom
  Device and no member of the warband can be
  Broken on the Wheel.
  ; Communicant Heresy: The Pilgrims of St.
  Methodius oppose the creation of Communicants
  and therefore cannot include them in their
  warbands. This includes Mercenaries.
  ; Treasure in Heaven: The Trench Pilgrims of
  this warband cannot be resurrected as MartyrPenintents.
  ; Chaste Order: While they revere the holy
  stigmata of the nuns of the order, the fathers of the
  monasteries shun the ecstatic revelry of many Trench
  Pilgrims and insist on modest dress. All Stigmatic
  Nuns of the warband must wear Standard Armour.
  In addition, the warband may only have a maximum
  of three Stigmatic Nuns.
  ; Gunsmith Monks: The warband can buy
  Machine Guns (LIMIT: 2) at a cost of 50 ducats
  each, an Automatic Rifle (LIMIT: 1) for 40 ducats
  and a Submachine Gun (LIMIT: 1) for 30 ducats.

  Trench Mortar 2-handed 48” Ignore Cover, +1D Injuries FIRE, HEAVY, BLAST 3”
  Rules: Specify a point on the battlefield within 36” (must be in line of sight) that you want to target. Next, take a
  Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location,
  multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot lands 2”
  away, as 7 – 5 = 2). The direction is decided by your opponent. All models within 3” of the 1 x 1 mm landing spot
  are hit as the shell explodes – no roll to hit is needed. This weapon has a BLAST radius of 3” – all models within this
  range are hit. Add +1 DICE to all injury rolls.

  attack, as long as all targets are within 6” of each other. After taking all three attacks the Activation of the model is

  up to five times instead of three if they take ALL the attacks as RISKY ACTIONS.

  the Gas Censer always ends the Activation of this model.
