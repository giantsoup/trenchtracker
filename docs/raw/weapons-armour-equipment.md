often highly elaborate sidearms. They see extensive use in close-quarter combat.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Pistol 1-handed 12”/Melee -
Rules: A model armed with a pistol can use it in melee as well as ranged combat (using Ranged Characteristic),
including as an off-hand weapon to execute an additional melee attack.
Automatic Pistol
Automatic pistols are symbols of prestige owing to their rarity and cost. They are excellent weapons when storming
trenches
or fighting in hand-to-hand combat. They boast a high rate of fire, though they can be hard to control even for the best
sharpshooters since they usually lack a stock.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords

ACTIONS with the automatic pistol instead of one if used as a ranged weapon. They can be against the same target or
two different ones.
Bolt Action Rifle
The workhorse of the Great War. Sturdy, highly reliable and reasonably accurate, it is no surprise that most of the
infantry
of the Great War carry this battlefield classic.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Bolt Action Rifle 2-handed 24” - -
Semi-Automatic Rifle
Semi-automatic rifles are said to be an invention of Marbas, the Devil who holds great wisdom and knowledge in
mechanical arts. They are excellent both at long range and in assault, combining accuracy and high rate of fire, though
they
are prone to jamming.

against the same target.
Jezzail
These long arms are by far the most common weapons carried by the soldiers of the Sultanate of the Great Iron Wall.
Their
barrels are smoothbore which limits their accurate range, but this is more than made up by the fact that this allows
them to
be loaded with different types of Alchemical ammunition made by the Jabirean Alchemists.

is ideal for close quarter combat thanks to its high rate of power and accuracy. The technology has not been perfected,
however, and sometimes leads to misfeeds and jams.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Auto Shotgun 2-handed 12” +1D Hit ASSAULT
Rules: Owing to its high accuracy, add +1 DICE to all rolls to hit and ignore the penalty to hit rolls when attacking
at long range. However, injuries are rolled with -1 DICE at long range due to the low penetration power.
Heavy Shotgun
Mostly used by Mechanized Heavy Infantry, this massive 8 bore shotgun is used to take down extremely powerful and
large opponents at short range. It is known as a “Wolf-Killer” in New Antioch as it is the weapon favoured by the
soldiery
of the Duke to take down the Heretic War Wolf assault beasts. Heavy Shotguns use tungsten-orichalcum alloy shot which
explains their enormous stopping power at short ranges.
Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
Heavy Shotgun 2-handed 12” +1D to Attacks, HEAVY
+2D to injuries at Short Range
Rules: This weapon rolls attacks with +1 DICE and rolls injuries at Short Range with +2 DICE.

  CONSUMABLE
  Rules: You can aim the Satchel Charge at either a 1mm x 1mm point on the ground or an enemy model within range.
  Next, take a Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its
  intended
  location, multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot
  lands 2” away, as 7-5=2). The direction is decided by your opponent. A Satchel Charge adds +1 DICE to injury rolls.
  Additionally, if the Satchel Charge lands directly on top of a model, it ignores that model’s armour.
  Molotov Cocktail
  Developed on the desperate Finnish battle frontier against Ice Demons, this improvised weapon consists of a glass
  bottle
  containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture plus a source of ignition.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords

  armour
  on a Critical Attack roll.
  Anti-Materiel Rifle
  Enormous long rifles designed to take out heavily armoured targets, vehicles and strongpoints. With the powerful
  armour
  available to the armies of the Great war, these terrifying weapons are much in demand. A downside is their enormous
  weight and terrifying recoil, and thus they are most often used by Communicants or Anointed who possess the
  supernatural
  strength to wield such weapons.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Anti-Materiel rifle 2-handed 36” +1D to Injury HEAVY, CRITICAL
  Rules: Ignores armour. Add +1 DICE when rolling on the Injury Chart.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Flamethrower
  A flamethrower is a terrifying weapon capable of projecting great streams of fire and flammable liquids at a distance.
  It
  is ideal for clearing bunkers, trenches and other fortifications, killing in a most horrific way. Consequently, it is
  greatly
  favoured by the Heretic forces.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Flame Thrower 2-handed 8” -1D Injuries, Ignores Armour FIRE
  Rules: A Flamethrower hits one model within range automatically with its Attack ACTION. Ignores Armour. Injuries
  caused by a Flamethrower are rolled with an additional -1 DICE. It also has the Keyword FIRE, so it causes an
  additional +1 BLOOD MARKER on enemies it hits, even if no other damage is caused.
  Heavy Flamethrower
  These massive flamethrowers are normally mounted on armoured vehicles, but those possessing uncanny strength may use
  them as infantry weapons.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords

  Melee Weapons
  All these weapons can be used by a model carrying them to perform a Melee Attack ACTION. Roll on the Action
  Success Chart to see if the attack hits. Add the number of +/-DICE as indicated by the Melee characteristics entry
  for the model in the relevant Warband List.
  Unarmed
  Fighting unarmed in the Great War is nigh-suicidal, but some troops carry no melee weapons or their weapons have been
  lost in the heat of the battle. In such cases, a warrior is forced to defend themselves with fists, kicks and their
  bare teeth.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Unarmed Special Melee -1D to Hit/Injuries -
  Rules: Models suffer -1 DICE when fighting unarmed, both to see if the attack hits and when rolling on the Injury
  Chart. Note that you can never fight with unarmed as an Off-Hand weapon to get an additional attack in melee.
  These rules simply cover all instances where the model fights unarmed and has no other Melee Actions in their
  profile.
  Knife/Dagger
  Virtually all soldiers carry a trench knife, dagger or other kind of blade for close quarter engagements. It may lack
  the
  devastating power of a great maul or other heavier melee weapons, but this humble weapon has taken countless lives
  during the Great War.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Knife/Dagger 1-Handed Melee -1D to Hit -
  Rules: Add -1 DICE every time you use a knife to see if the attack hits.
  Trench Club
  Trench Clubs are one of the most common weapons of the Great War, as melee combat is frequent and brutal. Usually
  made of wood with a metal tip from iron, lead or steel, trench clubs often feature spikes and hobnails. Most designs
  have
  some form of cord or leather strap at the end to wrap around the user’s wrist.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Trench Club 1-handed Melee - -
  Sword/Axe
  Because of the martial traditions of many proud nations and due to the advances in armour technology, swords and
  axes are extremely popular, especially amongst elite units and officers. They are supremely useful for finishing off
  downed
  opponents and causing profusely bleeding wounds.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Sword/Axe 1-handed Melee - CRITICAL

  Sacrificial Knife
  Terrifying blades blessed by the hand of a greater devil, these knives are used in Heretic rituals to sacrifice
  captives to the
  dark powers of Hell. They simply need to touch their opponents to cause indescribable pain and even the slightest
  wound
  often proves fatal from the agony alone. They are risky even to their wielders, as the merest scratch wounds friend
  and a foe
  alike.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Sacrificial Knife 1-handed Melee +2 on Injury results RISKY
  Rules: The Sacrificial Knife adds +2 to all rolls on the Injury Chart. For example, a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart

  Made from severed hands of Malebranche, the Tartarus Claws are granted by Arch-Devils only to those whose hearts are
  blackened with the sin of Wrath.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Tartarus Claws 2-handed Melee - -
  Rules: Tartarus Claws always come as a pair and do not allow the use of any other melee weapons. You can make two
  Attack ACTIONS with the Claws without the usual -1 DICE for the second attack. If the opponent is taken Down or
  Out of Action with the Claws you may immediately move the model up to 3”. If the move takes you into contact with
  another enemy model, this counts as a charge and you can make a second Melee Attack ACTION with the claws. You
  can only do this follow-up move once per Activation.

  Scourge/Battle Whip/Flail
  The metal whips of the Church are supremely good at both instilling discipline in the ranks of the faithful and

  Double-Handed Blunt Weapon
  Mauls, clubs, maces… these are large, cumbersome weapons, often made from sturdy wood with a metal tip of steel, lead

  127
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Armour
  A model can wear only one suit of armour at a time. Shields can be combined with any Armour unless otherwise
  indicated.
  Trench Shield
  Shields used in trench warfare are made of steel reinforced with Orichalcum to allow them to withstand even
  high-calibre
  bullets, or from metal mined from Infernal bedrock and shaped in the armouries of Pandæmonium, the Capital of Hell.
  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat, and cannot be switched out. Grants -1 to
  all injury rolls against the model. This bonus stacks with any armour the model wears, unless otherwise indicated. For
  the purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Trench Shield does not take a
  hand to wield but still functions as normal.
  Heavy Ballistic Shield
  These massive shields are made of aramid fibre mesh and orichalcum-steel alloy. They are so heavy that they can only
  be
  carried by Heavy Mechanized infantry, and even then they are too cumbersome to be used in fast paced melee. They are
  mainly used for protection during their ponderous advance towards the enemy.
  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat and cannot be switched out. The target
  is always considered to be in Cover when shot, and counts as fighting behind a defended obstacle when an enemy
  charges them. These bonuses cannot be combined with Polearms, shovels, cover or defended obstacles. For the
  purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Heavy Ballstic Shield does not take a
  hand to wield but still functions as normal.
  Standard Armour
  With the advancements in metallurgy and technology, both Faithful and Heretic armies are well-equipped with suits of
  alloy armour that can withstand an impact from a bullet or turn aside the sharpest of blades. Standard armour is
  usually
  mass-produced, but highly effective even against high-calibre weapons.
  Rules: -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model. Can be combined with any shield.
  Reinforced Armour
  Reinforced armour is a master-crafted suit made individually for the most important and elite troops. Each one is
  richly
  decorated and often carries the personal device of the warrior who wears it.
  Rules: Grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour.
  Machine Armour
  Combining the rarest of divine metal alloys and the latest technology of New Antioch, Machine Armour makes its wearer
  a virtual mobile tank.
  Rules: Grants a -3 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour, and treats Down Injury results
  as
  a Minor Hit instead (note that the TOUGH Keyword ability to avoid Out of Action with Down overrides this). Due
  to its bulk the wearer rolls D3 for a charge extra distance instead of D6. Machine armour cannot be combined with
  any shield. Models wearing Machine Armour may have a base size of 40mm if you wish, unless the model wearing it is
  already on 50mm or bigger base.
  If worn by a model that is not part of a New Antioch force/subfaction, the only bonus the armour gives is the -3
  injury modifier, as the chemical treatment that allows the wearer to withstand the rigors of the armour is a carefully
  guarded military secret. D3 charge distance remains in force.
  128
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Holy Icon Shield
  These shields are made from icons that have performed miracles. Mounted on blessed wood, they are harder than any
  steel
  and virtually indestructible. Only the most revered fighters in the service of the Church ever carry one.

  shield is effective even against weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.
  Holy Icon Armour
  Only a few of these suits of armour exist in all of Christendom. Covered with miraculous icons this suit of armour is
  protected by the very hand of Heaven and its wearer can withstand even direct hits from artillery.
  Rules: Grants -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model wearing this armour. This armour is effective even
  against
  weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.
  129
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Equipment
  Unless otherwise noted a model can only carry one piece equipment of the same type. Models may carry multiple
  different types of equipment, however.
  Combat Helmet
  The simple combat helmet has proven its value on the battlefield time and again.
  Rules: Ignores additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword SHRAPNEL.
  Iron Capirote
  A conical helmet blessed by the Church and often containing a fragment of a relic. Iron Capirotes shield their wearers
  from
  the psychological horror of war and allow them to face creatures from the pits of Hell unflinchingly.
  Rules: Negates the additional BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with SHRAPNEL Keyword. Makes the model
  immune to the effects of FEAR.
  Medi-kit
  Battlefield first aid has brought many soldiers back from the brink of death. Blessed ointments can seal fatal wounds
  completely, while the black blood of demons used by twisted heretic medics allows mangled troops to return to the
  fray.
  Rules: Models with a Medi-kit can take a RISKY ACTION to remove one BLOOD MARKER from any one friendly
  model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow one friendly model (including themselves) that is Down to
  regain their footing.
  Gas Mask
  Mustard Gas, phosgene, chlorine as well as noxious fumes from the bolgias of Hell plague the battlefield. The Gas Mask
  allows soldiers to withstand such attacks.
  Rules: Negates the extra BLOOD MARKER from attacks with the keyword GAS. Any such attacks suffer -1 DICE
  penalty to all injury rolls.
  Holy Relic
  Due to the threat to all Creation, the churches, cathedrals and basilicas have emptied their reliquaries and
  distributed
  their relics to the frontline troops to aid them in their battle against the damned.
  Rules: This model starts each game with +1 BLESSING MARKER.
  Armour-Piercing Bullets
  Advanced armour technology has forced the armouries of the Great War to forge new types of bullets. Expensive and
  labour-intensive to produce, these hardened tungsten rounds are more effective against battlefield armour.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
  with the following ability: Reduce the injury penalty from Armour and Shields by 1 until the end of the battle.
  Keyword: CONSUMABLE.
  Dum-Dum Bullets
  These hollow-point bullets are far more likely to cause fatal wounds than standard ammunition.

  (i.e. weapons which have the Keyword rifle in their name).
  Shovel
  Battlefield shovel allows troops to dig in and fight from cover in virtually any battlefield.
  Rules: A model equipped with a shovel always starts the game in cover if deployed on ground level, even if placed
  in open terrain. As soon as the model moves, it is no longer in cover. A model that is covered in this way retains the
  benefit of Cover even if the attacking model has an unobstructed view of it. If a model equipped with a shovel has
  two hands free, it can use it in Melee Combat as if it were a Trench Club.
  Troop Flag
  Most warbands and units carry banners, flags, standards, pennants or other symbols to rally the troops.
  Rules: Grants +1 DICE for all Morale tests as long as the model with the flag is not Down or Out of Action.
  Requires one hand to use.
  Martyrdom Pills
  Martyrdom pills are a potent mixture of mind-altering drugs and chemicals that inure a soldier against all pain and
  injury. However, it takes a tremendous toll on the body.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item. If it does, injuries rolled against it suffer -1 DICE
  until
  the end of the battle and the model is not affected by FEAR. Keywords: CONSUMABLE.
  Unholy Trinket
  Rules: When a model equipped with an Unholy Trinket fails a RISKY ACTION, that model may use this item. If it
