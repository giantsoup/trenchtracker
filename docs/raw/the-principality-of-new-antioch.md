The Principality of New Antioch
or three hundred years the Principality of
New Antioch has stood defiantly as the focal
point of the Church and the Faithful at the
very edge of the shadow cast by the Gate
of Hell. It is the Home of All Our Hopes,
the bulwark against Heretic forces and the first line of
defence against the devil’s might. Should New Antioch
fall, the Levant will be lost and the path to heartlands of
the Church will be wide open.
War has never left this corner of the world. The ancient
city of Antioch was destroyed by a mysterious demonic
weapon in the year 1545, but the Faithful never gave up
their positions in the ruins. Despite the lethal demonic
essence emanating from the crater that was left behind,
the garrison held on, even as mighty Constantinople fell
to the legions of Kimaris, Marquis of Hell.
Before it was destroyed, the ancient city of Antioch
was always the first line of defence to be put to test.
Thus it is no wonder that in the year 1559 the Sword
Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify the
city, and that a yearly tithe is to be sent to New Antioch
by all the Faithful nations, though this levy is rarely in
form of coin. Instead, endless supply trains of foodstuffs,
tools, ammunition, weaponry, machinery and skilled
workers and engineers come from across Europa and the
Mediterranean Sea, as well as the African dominions.
Since those days New Antioch has grown to be the
most important fortress-city in the world, the Sword
and the Shield of Europa and Africa. All the princes of
the Church and heads of the various states and domains
who oppose Hell understand that it is better to fight
their battles against the Heretics as far away from their
heartlands as possible. To this day New Antioch has
withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with
their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been
breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites,
metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within
them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a
vigilant watch over the walls day and night.
More than anything else, it is the volunteers who
come to serve under the Banner of Christ that ensure
the continuous existence of the Principality. Thus in the
streets of the city one can hear hundreds of languages
and dialects. One might observe hussars of the PolishLithuanian commonwealth brushing shoulders with
the last remnants of the Varangian Guard, or hear the
sermons of a street preacher from Eire extolling the
soldiery of Ethiopia to lay down their lives for the holy
cause. Perhaps they might even witness the Church
Engineers procession taking their latest invention to be
tested in the front lines.
As the nominal supreme commander of all the
Faithful armed forces, the Duke of New Antioch is a title
of unrivalled prestige and honour. But despite swearing
fealty to the Duke, in reality most of the troops from
across all of Christendom who come to do battle against
Hell operate in units of their own, taking commands
from their leaders and making their own strategic
decisions.
Still, some soldiers do indeed renounce their
citizenship and take up the cross, and come to serve
under Duke Constantine alone. Thus the standing army
of the Principality is the greatest single fighting force the
Faithful can muster, and those who serve on the walls of
the Home of Hopes are rightfully proud of their livery.
In recent years the Duke has despatched small forces
into No Man’s Land to gather intelligence, look for
artefacts of power, conduct raids on Heretic forces,
secure strategic strongpoints and loot the battlefields
for the wealth of coin and weaponry scattered across
the tortured landscape that stretches between New
Antioch and the Heretic domains over the centuries.
These warbands are simply given commission by the
Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster
their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth
and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there
is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing
to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot,
supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these
warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical
forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench
Pilgrims.
F OATH OF NEW ANTIOCH
“I swear to serve faithfully, loyally
and honourably the reigning Duke
and Duchess of New Antioch,
and their legitimate successors, to
devote myself to them with all my
strength, sacrificing even my life in
their defence.
I assume the same duties towards
the Princes of the Church and the
city of New Antioch itself, for she
is the Home of All Our Hopes. I
shall make war against the Heretics
without cessation and without
mercy.
I also promise my Commander
and the other Superiors respect, fidelity and obedience. Thus I swear,
may God and our Holy Patrons
assist me.”
Response of the guards to the Flag
of New Antioch;
“I swear to faithfully, loyally and
honourably observe all that is read
to me at this time. May God and
our Holy Patrons assist me!”

New Antioch Fireteams
Your warband may have up to two Fireteams. These
Fireteams may consist of any two models from your
warband. Models in Fireteams gain the Keyword
FIRETEAM. Fireteams gain the Concentrated Attack
rule:
; FIRETEAM: This model is part of a FIRETEAM
made up of two models. All models that are part of
the same FIRETEAM can be activated at the same
time without the opponent getting their turn in
between and can take their ACTIONS in any order
they wish, switching between the two models.
Note that if the Activation of either member of the
FIRETEAM forcefully ends (due to a failed RISKY
ACTION for example), it ends both Activations.
Allies cannot be part of a FIRETEAM.
; Concentrated Attack: If a model in the
FIRETEAM makes any kind of Attack ACTION
(ranged or melee) against an opponent, where the
other member of their FIRETEAM has already hit it
with an attack ACTION during the same activation,
the cost of a Bloodbath is reduced to three BLOOD
MARKERS against this opponent, whether the model
is standing or Down.

Elite: The officer corps
1 Lieutenant (Cost: 70 Ducats)
Your warband must include a Lieutenant when it is created.
Lieutenants are leaders of small squads or platoons of New Antioch’s soldiers, playing a
fundamental role on the distant frontlines of the Trench Crusade, displaying unwavering
resolve in preserving the unity and morale of their troops. Lieutenants might be the
favoured son or daughter of a noble family or gained their rank by impressing their
superiors with their exceptional strategic acumen and audacious bravery.
In addition to their command role, they are also responsible for acquiring new weapons,
arms, equipment and food for their troops. All too often this requires looting the battlefields
of No Man’s Land or even raiding settlements, since resupply can be sporadic at best.
Having rightfully earned their position, Lieutenants enjoy the privilege of selecting their
preferred arms and armour, often with the pick of the rarest battlefield finds. It is not
uncommon for a Lieutenant to wield a distinctive weapon, perhaps a family heirloom, an
idiosyncratic affectation or an ostentatious piece providing some much-needed swagger.

Warband Variant: Papal
States Intervention Force
The Papal states who all operate under the command
of the Supreme Pontiff of Rome rather than the Duke
of New Antioch are sometimes dispatched to the front
lines to perform a specific duty such as hunting down
and eliminating dangerous Heretic leaders or recovering
artefacts of great spiritual importance.
These Warbands are typically quite small but have access
to extremely elite soldiers and specialist equipment. They
are led by utterly devoted warrior-monks and priests
hand-picked by the Pope.
Rules
The Papal States Intervention Force has the following
special rules:
; Specialist Force: A Papal States Intervention
Force is recruited with 500 ducats and 11 Glory
Points when creating a warband for a campaign.
When recruiting a warband for a one-off battle, we
recommend using 700 ducats and 15 Glory Points.
; Swiss Guard: Up to four non-ELITE troopers
and the Lieutenant can be upgraded into Swiss
Guards at the cost of 5 ducats each. They are
immune to FEAR.
; Supreme Blessing: One model in the warband
may carry the crucifix given by the Supreme Pontiff.
This model can take further ACTIONS if it fails in an
attempted RISKY ACTION. Note that the action
fails, but you are allowed to try any other ACTIONS
on your profile without losing the Activation. If the
crucifix is lost, a new one can be acquired at the cost
of 3 Glory Points.
; Far from home: The Papal Intervention Force
may have no Trench Moles.
; Vatican’s representative: Papal States Warband
must include a Trench Cleric but does not have to
include a Lieutenant.
; Lector: Any Trench Cleric in the Papal
Intervention Force can select the following prayer
in addition to the ones usually available to a Trench
Cleric:
; Arise and be Healed! Select one friendly
model within 3” of the Priest and take
a RISKY ACTION. If successful, the warrior
immediately stands up if Down and loses
up to D3 BLOOD MARKERS or INFECTION
MARKERS (or any combination) of your
choice.
Warband Variant: Eire
Rangers
Eire is a stronghold of the Church and an ancient centre
of learning. Due to the constant and devastating raids of
the Heretic Navy, they are bitter enemies of the Infernal
forces. The Emerald Isle has endured hunger and ravaged
by the Black Grail, as well as a full-fledged invasion
aimed at destroying the famed House of Manuscripts
where many of the holiest of texts are kept. After this
century of ruthless battles and brutal guerrilla warfare
against the invaders, the warriors of Eire are now masters
of skirmish fighting, hit-and-run tactics and ambushes.
Elite Fianna warrior-hunters are especially adept at
these guerrilla tactics: they uphold the ancient tradition
of a band of roving warriors living off the land. While
seen as trouble-makers and godless hellraisers, they
are nevertheless expert skirmishers, and easily find
employment in the warbands who take the Cross and
travel to New Antioch to strike back at the enemy. These
warriors adorn themselves with grisly trophies in the
manner of their pagan ancestors, carrying skulls of the
vanquished – much to the irritation of the Church.
Due to the ravages of the wars, the island nation has few
resources for heavy armour or most intricate automatic
weapons, but they more than make up for this with their
skilled light infantry and knowledge of the lay of the land.
So when the Poet-King Tadhg O’Connor dispatches his
famed Rangers to aid the Principality of New Antioch
instead of paying the yearly tithe of Vienna, the Duke is
more than happy to accept these fierce warriors instead.
A rare latent Berserker trait runs in a few warrior
bloodlines of Eire. It can be made to manifest with the
Chemical Communion of the blood of the Meta-Christ.
Such fighters enter a state of battle-rage, where no bullet
or blade seems to cause them any harm.
Rules
The Eire Rangers has the following special rules:
; Fianna: Any Shocktroopers in an Eire Warband
can be made a member of Fianna, the famed
warrior-hunters. They cost +10 ducats each and have
the Keywords SKIRMISHER and INFILTRATOR.
; Carnyx: Your army can purchase a special
Carnyx instead of a generic musical instrument. This
horn is identical to a musical instrument (including
equipment restrictions and LIMIT), except it can be
carried by an ELITE model and the model carrying
it causes FEAR.
; Hit-and-run tactics: If a model of this warband
uses the Retreat ACTION to move away from
Combat, enemies have a -1 DICE penalty to hit
rolls with their free attack.

Warband Variant:
Stoßtruppen of the Free
State of Prussia
When the need to take out an enemy strongpoint or
assault an especially powerful defensive line of trenches
or redoubts arises, the Duke of Antioch often calls
upon the famed Stoßtruppen forces of the Free State of
Prussia. These elite units often operate in deep forward
positions, and quite often they carry secret orders or
specific missions from the Princes of the Church or the
New Antioch High Command.
The Free State Shocktroopers are selected and trained
specifically to perform lightning assaults, master the
firearms of close assault, and operate in Fireteams that
are perfectly synchronised in their combined arms
tactics. Admittance to this elite group is strictly by merit.
All members must be decorated athletes, under 25 years
of age, unmarried and must have demonstrated a high
level of aggression on the battlefield. Of all the soldiers
serving Prussia, Stoßtruppen have by far the highest
casualty rate. When inducted into the ranks, all swear an

; Forward Positions: Up to two Shocktroops can
have the Keyword INFILTRATOR at the cost of
+10 ducats per model.
; Rapid Assault: At the cost of +5 ducats per
model, any Shocktroopers and Lieutenants may add
+1 DICE to all their Dash ACTIONS.
; Specialised Equipment: This warband has
LIMIT:4 for Submachine guns. Automatic
Shotguns and Automatic Pistols are not limited
to ELITE. The warband may have no Grenade
Launchers and only one Machine Gun.
; Troop Selection: The warband must have at
least two shocktroopers and can have up to eight.
the warband can have only one mechanised heavy
infantry, one sniper priest and no trench moles.
; Lightly-armoured: Apart from mechanised
heavy infantry and the lieutenant, no model in
the warband can be equipped with reinforced or

; Light Melee: Prussian shocktroopers lose the
Assault Drill ability.

Prussian Special Equipment
Tank-splitter sword 15 ducats
It takes years of gruelling Mensur practice and field drills to acquire the required precision and speed to use the specialist
tank-splitter swords of the Gardekorps. Despite their great size (often over 6 feet long!) they are remarkably light, and due
to the large quantities of Orichalcum used in their forging process, they are virtually unbreakable. They are often used to
disable tanks and other armoured vehicles by either slicing their armour open or disabling them with an accurate swing
to sever their tracks. Before any battle they are treated with a special metal-melting chemical compound which melts the
armour, making it far deadlier against armoured targets than those who wear none.

as well as dreams of acquiring valuable loot to send back

some Devil-worshippers!
The Heretic submarine fleet harries the shores of the
Kingdom constantly, carrying off their young in chains
to be sacrificed in the dark altars of the Arch-devils and
their hatred towards Hell’s forces runs deep. The fleet
of Britain and their famed moving fortress are reserved
in guarding their own shores, causing friction and
resentment among their northern neighbours, whose
coastal defences are far less comprehensive. As is the
tradition in Alba, these warbands favour close quarters
combat and fierce charges over defence and long-range
attacks.

has been frustrated. For this front is every bit as bitterly
contested as the European theatre of war. Here the
heretic legions are opposed by a coalition of Nubia,
Numidia and the Solomonic Empire of Abyssinia
(more commonly known as the Ethiopian Empire in
Africa) that have thrown their lot together to resist
the invader. Blood stains the waters of the Nile as the
coalition struggles to contain the grinding offensives of
Mammon’s Legion of the Ten Golden Horns. The plan
of the Prince of Greed is two-fold: to overcome the holy
churches of Lalibela – desecrating and auctioning off
the legendary relics within the churches and cathedrals
of Axum – and to claim the fabled gold mines of the
Queen of Sheba for himself, which he covets beyond any
other treasure trove on Earth.
War has honed the soldiers of Ethiopia into masters
of mobile warfare and taking the enemy on in loose
formation, a style of fighting well-suited to their rugged
country where scarce roads restrict the movements of
large armies. Most levies fight armed with rifles, seeking
to close in on the enemy to ensure the effectiveness of
their volleys; while the Chewa are the warrior-elite,
trained in hand-to-hand combat since childhood.
They are encouraged to take on lions and other fierce
predators as part of their upbringing, and warriors that
have taken down a male lion single-handedly have the
honour of wearing its mane as a headdress. Their famed
war cry “Together! Together!” is often the last thing the
invaders hear.
Claiming a direct lineage from the legendary queen of
Sheba and King Solomon, the Emperors of Abyssinia
are staunch members of the Faithful alliance, and the
representative of the African continent in the Sword
Congress of Vienna. It is a matter of pride and prestige
to the House of Solomon that the tithe to New Antioch
is met punctually. So once in seven years the Negarit war
drums sound the kitet, the call to arms. The volunteers
gather at Axum, the spiritual capital of the nation, where
the Ark of the Covenant is said to be kept under the
watchful eyes of warrior monks who are born to their
role and never leave their post.
There is never any lack of warriors willing to join the
expeditionary force to aid New Antioch. Adventure,
unrivalled status given to those who go to serve the Duke
and the chance to fight the enemy in their heartlands
ensures that the bravest young soldiers compete for the
chance to join the expeditionary force.
Before being accepted into this force, all volunteers
to New Antioch must make a pilgrimage to Abuna
Yemata Guh, the chapel that rests on a mountainside
at a dizzying height of some 8500 feet. It is the
most inaccessible place of worship in the world, and
volunteers must travel to receive the blessing from this
shrine in the sky carrying their full military kit and gear.
Miraculously, there have been exceedingly few deaths
caused by soldiers losing their footing and plummeting
to their deaths. Each one of those who have fallen have
been found to be a heretic infiltrator, and their broken
and rotting bodies are left unburied as a warning to those
traitors who would defile the sanctity of the shrine.
Once the pilgrimage is done, the forces assemble and
are laden with gold, silver, precious stones, icons and
holy relics as gifts from the Emperor to the Duke. The
warriors of the Emperor march to the hidden ports of
the coast that are still free of the enemy. There is no
land route for the warriors of Ethiopia to reach the
Principality and the Heretic Fleet dominates both the
Erythraean Sea and the Red Sea, leaving the perilous
crossing of the mediterranean as the only viable option.
Thus there is the war on the waves of the Mediterranean
as the Faithful fleet clashes with heretic dreadnoughts.
Ships will be sunk and the gold from the mines of the
Queen of Sheba is lost to the sea, but when the songs
and drums of the warriors of Solomonic Throne can be
heard in the harbour and echoing on the famed walls of
New Antioch, the citizens know that aid has come once
more.
Fewer than one in ten volunteers ever return to the
rock-hewn Churches of Lalibela to give thanks for their
deliverance. The rest give their lives in brutal battles in
No Man’s Land, like countless millions before them. In
the eyes of these survivors one can catch a glimpse of the
horrors that have scarred them for life.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Rules
The Expeditionary Force of Abyssinia has the following
special rules:
; Chewa: Any shocktroopers or ELITE models
in an Abyssinian warband can be made a member of
Chewa, the traditional warrior-elite. This costs +5
ducats per model and can be done after the model
has been recruited. These models gain +1 DICE
against enemies that are in melee combat with a
model other than the Chewa. If this enemy is in
melee with 2+ other models, this bonus is increased
to +2 DICE.
; Faith of Ethiopia: The sect of the Sniper Priests
does not operate in the Solomonic Dynasty, so your
warband cannot contain any Sniper Priests.
; Flanking Forces: The warband cannot have
Trench Moles, but instead you can upgrade up to
four Yeomen to Vanguards at the cost of +5 ducats
each. They have the following special rules: Unless
the scenario prohibits use of the special deployment
of INFILTRATORS, you may deploy the Vanguard
on any table edge as long as they are at least 8” away
from any enemy model after INFILTRATORS are
deployed. Vanguard can also be deployed in your
own deployment zone as standard.
; Short-Range Marksmanship: Yeomen,
Vanguard and the Lieutenant in this warband gain
+1 DICE to all hit rolls if they are using their
ranged weapons at short range (i.e. half or less of
their maximum range). This bonus does not apply to
GRENADES or weapons with the Keyword HEAVY.
; Abyssinian Healers: Your warband can have up
to two Combat Medics.
; Holy Warriors: The warband may include
up to two Holy Warriors (use Trench Cleric
characteristics) and they can each choose to replace
their “Onwards, Christian Soldiers!” ability with
one from the Abyssinian Holy Warrior abilities list
below.
; Chieftain Panoply: The Mechanized Infantry
of the warband cannot be upgraded to use Machine
Armour.
; Weapons of Mobile Warfare: Your warband can
have a maximum of three ranged weapons with the
Keyword HEAVY. This limitation does not include
satchel charges.
Abyssinian Holy Warrior Abilities
; Blessed Psalm: As an ACTION, the Warrior
removes one BLESSING MARKER it has and adds it
to any other member of the warband. This ACTION
succeeds automatically.
; God’s Mercy: Select one friendly model within
3” of the warrior and take an ACTION. If successful,
the target immediately stands if Down and loses up
to one BLOOD MARKER or INFECTION MARKER
(your choice) it has.
