Armour
A model can wear only one suit of armour at a time. Shields can be combined with any Armour unless otherwise
indicated.
Trench Shield
Shields used in trench warfare are made of steel reinforced with Orichalcum to allow them to withstand even high-calibre
bullets, or from metal mined from Infernal bedrock and shaped in the armouries of Pandæmonium, the Capital of Hell.
Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat, and cannot be switched out. Grants -1 to
all injury rolls against the model. This bonus stacks with any armour the model wears, unless otherwise indicated. For
the purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Trench Shield does not take a
hand to wield but still functions as normal.
Heavy Ballistic Shield
These massive shields are made of aramid fibre mesh and orichalcum-steel alloy. They are so heavy that they can only be
carried by Heavy Mechanized infantry, and even then they are too cumbersome to be used in fast paced melee. They are
mainly used for protection during their ponderous advance towards the enemy.
Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat and cannot be switched out. The target
is always considered to be in Cover when shot, and counts as fighting behind a defended obstacle when an enemy
charges them. These bonuses cannot be combined with Polearms, shovels, cover or defended obstacles. For the
purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Heavy Ballstic Shield does not take a
hand to wield but still functions as normal.
Standard Armour
With the advancements in metallurgy and technology, both Faithful and Heretic armies are well-equipped with suits of
alloy armour that can withstand an impact from a bullet or turn aside the sharpest of blades. Standard armour is usually
mass-produced, but highly effective even against high-calibre weapons.
Rules: -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model. Can be combined with any shield.
Reinforced Armour
Reinforced armour is a master-crafted suit made individually for the most important and elite troops. Each one is richly
decorated and often carries the personal device of the warrior who wears it.
Rules: Grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour.
Machine Armour
Combining the rarest of divine metal alloys and the latest technology of New Antioch, Machine Armour makes its wearer
a virtual mobile tank.
Rules: Grants a -3 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour, and treats Down Injury results as
a Minor Hit instead (note that the TOUGH Keyword ability to avoid Out of Action with Down overrides this). Due
to its bulk the wearer rolls D3 for a charge extra distance instead of D6. Machine armour cannot be combined with
any shield. Models wearing Machine Armour may have a base size of 40mm if you wish, unless the model wearing it is
already on 50mm or bigger base.
If worn by a model that is not part of a New Antioch force/subfaction, the only bonus the armour gives is the -3
injury modifier, as the chemical treatment that allows the wearer to withstand the rigors of the armour is a carefully
guarded military secret. D3 charge distance remains in force.

Holy Icon Shield
These shields are made from icons that have performed miracles. Mounted on blessed wood, they are harder than any steel
and virtually indestructible. Only the most revered fighters in the service of the Church ever carry one.
Rules: Takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat. Grants -1 to all injury rolls against the model. This
shield is effective even against weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.
Holy Icon Armour
Only a few of these suits of armour exist in all of Christendom. Covered with miraculous icons this suit of armour is
protected by the very hand of Heaven and its wearer can withstand even direct hits from artillery.
Rules: Grants -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model wearing this armour. This armour is effective even against
weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.

Equipment
Unless otherwise noted a model can only carry one piece equipment of the same type. Models may carry multiple
different types of equipment, however.
Combat Helmet
The simple combat helmet has proven its value on the battlefield time and again.
Rules: Ignores additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword SHRAPNEL.
Iron Capirote
A conical helmet blessed by the Church and often containing a fragment of a relic. Iron Capirotes shield their wearers from
the psychological horror of war and allow them to face creatures from the pits of Hell unflinchingly.
Rules: Negates the additional BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with SHRAPNEL Keyword. Makes the model
immune to the effects of FEAR.
Medi-kit
Battlefield first aid has brought many soldiers back from the brink of death. Blessed ointments can seal fatal wounds
completely, while the black blood of demons used by twisted heretic medics allows mangled troops to return to the fray.
Rules: Models with a Medi-kit can take a RISKY ACTION to remove one BLOOD MARKER from any one friendly
model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow one friendly model (including themselves) that is Down to
regain their footing.
Gas Mask
Mustard Gas, phosgene, chlorine as well as noxious fumes from the bolgias of Hell plague the battlefield. The Gas Mask
allows soldiers to withstand such attacks.
Rules: Negates the extra BLOOD MARKER from attacks with the keyword GAS. Any such attacks suffer -1 DICE
penalty to all injury rolls.
Holy Relic
Due to the threat to all Creation, the churches, cathedrals and basilicas have emptied their reliquaries and distributed
their relics to the frontline troops to aid them in their battle against the damned.
Rules: This model starts each game with +1 BLESSING MARKER.
Armour-Piercing Bullets
Advanced armour technology has forced the armouries of the Great War to forge new types of bullets. Expensive and
labour-intensive to produce, these hardened tungsten rounds are more effective against battlefield armour.
Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
with the following ability: Reduce the injury penalty from Armour and Shields by 1 until the end of the battle.
Keyword: CONSUMABLE.
Dum-Dum Bullets
These hollow-point bullets are far more likely to cause fatal wounds than standard ammunition.
Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
with the CRITICAL keyword until the end of the battle. Keywords: CONSUMABLE, CRITICAL.

Incendiary Ammunition
Developed by Aym, the Great Duke of Hell, these bullets set any target they hit on fire.
Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
with the FIRE keyword until the end of the battle. Keywords: FIRE, CONSUMABLE.
Tracer Bullets
Tracer bullets allow soldiers to adjust their aim efficiently.
Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
with +1D to hit with ranged attacks until the end of the battle. Keywords: CONSUMABLE.
Sniper Scope
These optical aiming devices are favoured by Snipers to aid in their aiming at long distances.
Rules: Negates the penalty for Long Range if the model has not moved during this Activation. Only usable with rifles
(i.e. weapons which have the Keyword rifle in their name).
Shovel
Battlefield shovel allows troops to dig in and fight from cover in virtually any battlefield.
Rules: A model equipped with a shovel always starts the game in cover if deployed on ground level, even if placed
in open terrain. As soon as the model moves, it is no longer in cover. A model that is covered in this way retains the
benefit of Cover even if the attacking model has an unobstructed view of it. If a model equipped with a shovel has
two hands free, it can use it in Melee Combat as if it were a Trench Club.
Troop Flag
Most warbands and units carry banners, flags, standards, pennants or other symbols to rally the troops.
Rules: Grants +1 DICE for all Morale tests as long as the model with the flag is not Down or Out of Action.
Requires one hand to use.
Martyrdom Pills
Martyrdom pills are a potent mixture of mind-altering drugs and chemicals that inure a soldier against all pain and
injury. However, it takes a tremendous toll on the body.
Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item. If it does, injuries rolled against it suffer -1 DICE until
the end of the battle and the model is not affected by FEAR. Keywords: CONSUMABLE.
Unholy Trinket
Rules: When a model equipped with an Unholy Trinket fails a RISKY ACTION, that model may use this item. If it
does, its Activation is not ended. Keyword: CONSUMABLE.
Unholy Relic
An artefact bestowed with unholy power. Examples include Nephilim heads, desecrated splinters of the True Cross or
mummified body parts of fallen saints and bishops.
Rules: A model equipped with an Unholy relic radiates a truly malignant aura and causes FEAR.

Small icons of saints, great angels and holy warriors are a common sight amongst the Trench Pilgrims. They are hung on
rosaries, belts, or attached to portable shrines carried on the Pilgrims’ backs.

penalty to all injury rolls.

size of 40mm. Can be destroyed if any type of attack hits it.
Hellbound Soul Contract
An infernal contract signed by a Heretic and the devil who will come to collect the damned soul when death is close. The
mortal signatory bursts into infernal flames when seriously wounded.
Rules: When this model is taken Out of Action, any model in melee combat with them immediately suffers +1
BLOOD MARKER unless the model ignores damage from sources with the Keyword FIRE.
Binoculars
It is quite common for officers to carry finely-crafted battlefield binoculars with them on the battlefield to survey the land
ahead, spot hidden enemy troops and observe any sign of movement.
Rules: Any enemy Infiltrator cannot be placed closer than 16” of this model.
Musical Instrument
Horns, drums, trumpets, whistles, bagpipes and many other types of instruments are used extensively in the battles of the
Great War. They can bolster the hearts of those facing the horrors of Hell – or they can recite terrifying hymns praising the
lords of the Inferno!
Rules: Any friendly models within 4” of the musician who is not Down can add +1 DICE to their Dash ACTIONS.
Musical Instruments take one hand to use at all times as if it were a weapon.

vertical obstacle.
