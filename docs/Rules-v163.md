TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Greetings all, be you a faithful follower of the Church or servant of the
Inferno!
It is our pleasure to present to you the latest draft of the Trench
Crusade playtest rules. Thank you for supporting the game!
This draft covers the basic rules, most common weapons, armour and
equipment, scenarios, keywords used in the game as well as several warband lists, not
just the blasphemous Heretic Legion and the crazed Trench Pilgrims! We suggest you
start with the Quick Start section of the rules to familiarise yourself with the basics.
To state the obvious, these are not the final rules. They are missing explanatory
diagrams and gameplay examples, campaign and exploration rules, supernatural
powers, some warband lists and scenarios, terrain and miniature painting sections and
much, much more. However, they should allow you to sample the game and learn its
basics as we await the full release.
Neither layout nor the art presents the final quality, and due to the constant cycle
of playtesting and revisions, there are bound to be mistakes as well as plenty of rules
that are going to change in the course of development. Please bear this in mind as you
acquaint yourself with these rules. Feedback is welcome, and the best way is to join the
Trench Crusade Discord channel and post your questions and comments there. We will
strive to answer them to our best ability.
We plan to release more playtest rules in the near future (including rules for all
the models released in the initial Kickstarter), as well as more scenarios, warbands
and rules for campaigns. We will also revise the core rules when they change during
development and share these with the community as well.
The best way to keep abreast of all the latest developments is to sign up to our
newsletter at: www.trenchcrusade.com
I hope you’ll enjoy your time with Trench Crusade. I firmly believe it is the best
ruleset I’ve written in my 27-year career as a professional game designer.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
rench Crusade is a skirmish-scale tabletop
miniature game that will plunge players
deep into a horrifying alternate timeline.
During the Crusades a heretical band of
Templars dared defy the Almighty. Casting
aside their sacred vows they unleashed the forces of Hell
upon the Earth.
Over 800 years later, in the Year of Our Lord 1914, this
brutal, merciless war between the forces of Heaven and
Hell rages on. This is not merely a fight for survival – it
is a cataclysmic struggle that will decide the very fate of
humanity’s soul.
The following rules will immerse you in the trenches,
guiding your warband through fierce skirmish battles as
you vie for supremacy in No Man’s Land.
What You Need To Play
Miniatures
Each player commands a Warband, which typically
consists of 6-20 models. While there is no ironclad rule
on the scale of models, the heroic 32mm scale is what
we use in our games. If you prefer another scale, do not
worry – Witchburners will not be dispatched to cleanse
you for your lack of scale purity!
Tabletop
You will also need a gaming surface to play on. We
suggest two surface sizes for games: 48” x 48” or 36”
x 36”. This allows the game to be played on a typical
kitchen table.
Terrain
Terrain is also necessary, and the more you have of it, the
better! Trench Crusade is a game of position and tactics,
so different types of elevation, cover and varied terrain
pieces will all enhance your gaming experience.
Measuring tool
To measure distances, you will need a tape measure
or measuring stick. Trench Crusade uses the Imperial
measurement system which means movement is
measured in inches.
Dice
Next, you will require dice. Each player should have
eight 6-sided dice (D6s) in their own distinct colours.
Blood Marker Dice
Finally, you will need a few red 6-sided dice to represent
BLOOD MARKERS (explained in the rules below).
Game Turn & Activations
Players Activate their models in alternating order. A
single Turn consists of both players Activating all their
models once.
For example, the first player will choose a model to
Activate, take any ACTIONS available to the model, and
then it is time for the next player to activate one of their
models.
You can then choose any model in your warband (that
has not yet been Activated) and Activate that model.
This model can now Move, take ACTIONS and use
special skills and equipment as you see fit. When your
model’s Activation is over, your opponent can then
Activate one of their models and so on.
The player with the lowest number of models currently
remaining on the table will decide who will start with
the first Activation at the beginning of each Turn. If
both players have the same number of models, roll a D6
and whoever rolls highest gets to decide.
When each player has Activated all their models, the
Turn is over.
Actions
Once Activated a model can take as many or as few
ACTIONS during each Activation as you wish, in any
order you choose. However, each ACTION can only be
taken once per Activation unless otherwise stated in the
rules. Thus you could fire your weapon, then Move and
then Dash during the same Activation, or Dash and then
Charge and so on.
Common ACTIONS that all models can take are listed
Playtest rules
T Keywords
Many weapons, troop types,
equipment and armour have
associated Keywords. These are
always depicted clearly in capital
letters. For example, all large and
cumbersome weapons have the
Keyword HEAVY. This allows
the player to separate lore and
general descriptions from rules.
Thus, if the rules dictate that
“No model carrying a HEAVY
weapon can add D6 to their
charge move”, this applies to every
single weapon with said Keyword.
Refer to the Keywords section on
page 12 for the full list to see their
effects on gameplay.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
in Melee combat, it may attack as detailed in the
Melee Weapon’s entry in the rules. The attacker must
be able to see at least part of the target – no Melee
attacks through walls!
; Any other ACTIONS: Many models have other
possible ACTIONS they can take during their
Activations. Refer to the Warband Lists for details.
Risky Actions: If you fail a RISKY ACTION, this
always ends the activation of the model and your
opponent can now activate one of their models!
+Dice and -Dice
Rules often have modifiers to dice rolls marked as
+DICE and -DICE (for example, shooting from elevated
positions adds +1 DICE to ranged attacks against
enemies below). These are shown in the format of
+1 DICE and -1 DICE. Many models have them on
their profile for Melee and Ranged attacks, and things
like range, cover and so on can apply them to the dice
rolls you make on the Action Success Chart or Injury
Chart. For each +DICE, add one dice to the dice pool
of the 2D6 roll you are about to make. Thus +1 DICE
makes the roll a total of 3D6. Then roll all the dice and
pick the two highest numbers. If two +DICE are added,
roll 4D6 and pick the two highest and so on.
The -DICE works in reverse. For each -1 DICE, add
one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are about
to make. Thus -1 DICE makes the roll a total of 3D6.
Then roll all the dice and pick the two lowest numbers.
below. Be sure to consult the profile of each warrior in
your warband to see what ACTIONS their abilities allow
them to perform in addition to these.
Several ACTIONS require you to roll on the Action
Success Chart (see below) to see if you succeed. If
you succeed, you take the ACTION as described in the
rules. If you fail, you can still move or take any other
ACTIONS the model may have. If the ACTION is classed
as a RISKY ACTION and you fail, the activation of the
model is over and your opponent can now activate one
of their models!
; Move: When a model takes this ACTION during
its activation, choose one of the three options below.
The Move ACTION does not require a roll on the
Action Success Chart.
Standard Move: The model moves up to its
Movement characteristic.
Charge: Choose an enemy model (that the
charging model can see) within 12” as the target.
The charging model then moves directly toward
that target via the shortest and most effective
route possible determined by distance, with
a D6” bonus to its Movement characteristic.
This movement can allow the charging model
to move within 1” of the target, putting the
two models in Melee Combat with each other.
A model cannot Charge if they have taken the
Make a Ranged Attack ACTION during this
Activation, unless they made a single ranged
attack with a weapon that has the Keyword
ASSAULT.
Retreat: The model moves up to its Movement
characteristic and it may leave Melee Combat
during this movement. Each enemy model in
Melee Combat with the retreating model may
immediately take a Melee Attack ACTION with
a single melee weapon that it has. Resolve the
effects of this attack before moving the retreating
model.
; Dash: The model must succeed with a RISKY
ACTION. If successful, the model takes the Standard
Move ACTION as described above. This can be done
in addition to any other ACTION.
; Make a Ranged Attack: The model may shoot
with a ranged weapon that it is equipped with. A
model engaged in Melee Combat cannot shoot.
A model cannot make a Ranged Attack during an
Activation in which they have Charged, unless they
made a single ranged attack with a weapon that has
the Keyword ASSAULT.
; Make a Melee Attack: If the model is engaged
Pre-measuring
Unless the rules specifically tell
you otherwise, you are allowed to
measure distances to see if you are
in range for shooting, charging
and so on.
Climbing & Jumping
During any movement made by a
model, it can climb surfaces, jump
across gaps and down ledges to
navigate the battlefield. Climbing
up and down surfaces or jumping
across gaps costs movement as
normal. Jumping down doesn’t
cost movement but might be
dangerous based on the height of
the jump (see page 7 for detailed
rules).
Action Success Chart
When you take an ACTION (including Melee
and Ranged Attacks), roll 2D6 and add any
+DICE or -DICE from the character’s profile,
injuries or other sources, pick the two highest (or
lowest if any -DICE were applied) and consult
the chart below to see if the ACTION succeeded:
2-6 Failure
7-11 Success
12+ Critical success: Ranged and Melee
Attacks add +1 DICE to injury
rolls if your result is a Critical Success
when determining if they hit.
If you succeed, you take the ACTION as described
in the rules. If you fail, you can still move or take
any other ACTIONS the model may have access
to. If the ACTION fails, and it was RISKY, the
model’s Activation ends immediately.
6
TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
If -2 DICE are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two
lowest and so on.
Gameplay example: A Trench Pilgrim model is shooting
at a Heretic trooper with a musket. The Heretic is in cover,
which grants -1 DICE to any ranged attacks. The Pilgrim
rolls 3D6 and gets 5, 5 and 1. The two lowest numbers are
picked for a result of 6. As the Pilgrim needed 7 to hit, the
shot missed!
Before rolling dice, add any +DICE and -DICE to the
dice pool. If the pool contains both +DICE and -DICE,
remove pairs of opposite dice until only one type is
remaining.
Blood Markers
During a battle your warriors can be wounded due to
enemy attacks, the use of supernatural powers, falling
from great heights and so on – see the Injury Chart for
details. This damage is tracked via BLOOD MARKERS. In
addition to wounds, they represent exhaustion, concussion,
shellshock, physical and mental strain and so on.
Each time one of your models suffers such damage, place a
BLOOD MARKER (red dice) next to the model to track this
damage. Use the pip number on each dice to indicate the
number of BLOOD MARKERS the model has. Every time
this model takes an ACTION (shooting, melee attacks and
so on), your opponent can declare that they are spending
one or more BLOOD MARKERS it has to add -1 DICE to
the dice pool when the roll on the Action Success Chart
is made. Multiple markers can be applied to any single roll
if the target model has multiple BLOOD MARKERS to be
converted.
The BLOOD MARKERS can also be used by your
opponent when the model suffers damage from any
source. Each marker can be converted into +1 DICE on
the Injury Chart roll, making a serious injury far more
likely and, just like with ACTIONS, multiple markers can
be used to influence a single roll on the Injury Chart.
BLOODBATH
You can roll an additional D6 on injury rolls at the
cost of six BLOOD MARKERS on any model, or at the
cost of three BLOOD MARKERS if the target is Down.
This means that instead of rolling 2D6 on your typical
weapon, you roll 3D6 on your injury roll and add the
numbers together. Weapons such as the Artillery Witch’s
Infernal Bomb would therefore roll 4D6 and add the
results together (3D6+1D6).
Gameplay Example: A Trench Pilgrim model has
sustained a wound during the battle and has two BLOOD
MARKERS on them. A Heretic Trooper shoots at the
Pilgrim with his trusty bolt action rifle, rolls an 8 and
hits! The Heretic player decides to use one of the BLOOD
MARKERS to make the shot more likely to injure. The
Heretic player rolls 3D6 (2D6 +1 DICE from the spent
marker) and consults the Injury Chart. The result is 4, 5
and 1. Since one +DICE was used, the player picks the two
highest numbers which total 9. The Pilgrim is taken out of
action!
Blessing Markers
BLESSING MARKERS are similar to BLOOD
MARKERS. Supernatural powers, holy relics and many
other sources may grant these to a model, which can
then be expended to aid the ACTIONS of the model.
Every time the model takes an ACTION (shooting,
dashing, melee attacks and so on), you can declare
that they are spending one or more of any BLESSING
MARKERS the model has. You can add +1 DICE to the
dice pool when any roll on the Action Success Chart
is made. Additionally, whenever the opponent makes
an injury roll against a model, that model may spend a
BLESSING MARKER to apply a -1 DICE penalty to
that injury roll. Multiple BLESSING MARKERS can be
applied to any single roll if the target model has more
than one BLESSING MARKER.
Movement
All models in the game can Move when Activated unless
otherwise indicated in the rules. Each model can move
up to the number of inches indicated in their profile,
though they can move less and not at all if you wish.
There are a number of general rules that apply to all of
the movement that a model takes during its Activation.
Certain types of movement, such as Falling or the
knockback effect of an Artillery Witch’s Infernal Bomb,
are not subject to these rules. Regardless of the type
of movement, a model cannot move off the battlefield
unless a rule specifically states so.
; A model cannot enter Melee Combat (within 1”
of enemy models) unless it Charges.
; A model cannot leave Melee Combat (within 1”
of enemy models) at any point during Movement
unless it is Retreating.
; A model in Melee Combat cannot otherwise
move unless they began their Activation in Melee
Combat, take the standard Move ACTION and
remain in Melee Combat with every model that
they were in Melee Combat with at the start of their
Activation.
; A model can move through friendly models if it
has enough movement to move past them entirely.
; A model cannot move off the battlefield unless a
Denied Rule
A situation may occur where
different rules and abilities
conflict with each other creating
a rules impasse. A rule might
require a model to do something,
while another rule says it cannot
do this. In these situations the
prohibition takes precedence. If a
model cannot do something, this
overrides any rule that says it must
do another action.
Fractions
In all cases where the rules refer
to fractions, always round up to
the nearest whole number when
necessary. For example, if your
warband has nine models and the
rule calls for something to effect
half of the entire force, round
4.5 models up to 5. On the other
hand, if a model with a Movement characteristic of 9” had its
movement halved, that could
become 4.5” without needing to
round to a whole number.
Going Over the Top
All trenches are considered to
have fire steps and footholds, and
therefore climbing out of them
requires no RISKY ACTION
test.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
rule specifically states so.
Movement (including charging) is usually the only
action a model can take that does not require you to roll
2D6 to determine whether you are successful or not,
unless otherwise noted in the rules.
; Charging: Select an enemy model that is within
12” of the charging model to be the target. If the
charging model does not have line of sight to its
target, it must succeed with a RISKY ACTION
before proceeding. Roll a D6 (the charge roll)
and add it to the charging model’s Movement
characteristic (with a maximum distance of 12”).
The charging model must move this distance toward
the target by the shortest and most effective route
possible by distance. Jumping, Climbing or moving
through Dangerous Terrain is always optional during
a Charge, even if it is the shortest route, though the
new route avoiding such obstacles must still be as
short as possible.
If after completing this movement the charging
model is within 1” of the target, the charging model
is considered to have successfully charged the target
and is now in Melee Combat. If the charging model
does not reach its target, the Charge is considered
to have failed, but it remains where it is after the
movement.
; Charging Multiple Enemies: A model may
target multiple enemies with a single Charge if there
is a space that the charging model could occupy
(within 12”) that would place it in Melee Combat
with every target of its Charge. It still only makes a
single Charge.
; Interposing Models during a Charge: If a
charging model would pass within 1” of an enemy
model that is not the target of its Charge, its charge
immediately ends and it is considered to have
charged the interposing model instead.
; Diving Charge: If a charging model jumps
down as part of a Charge, it landed within 2” of its
target and it jumped from a ledge that was at least 3”
(measured from the target’s base) and no more than
6” (measured from the charging model’s landing
space), it may convert its Charge into a Diving
Charge.
Place the charging model in any space within 1” of
the target and take a RISKY ACTION. If successful,
the charging model gains a +1 DICE bonus to hit
and to injure the target, and the charging model
ignores the target’s Defended Obstacle bonus (if it
has one) for the remainder of its Activation. If the
RISKY ACTION fails, the model is Down and is
injured as per the rules for Falling.
; Climbing: A model can move up or down
ladders, ramps, ropes, stairs and other devices meant
for climbing as a normal part of any movement it
takes. This costs movement as normal. As a RISKY
ACTION, a model may also attempt to climb up or
down sheer surfaces, such as walls, but it must have
enough remaining movement to clear the entire
height. If this RISKY ACTION fails, the model
remains where it is.
; Jumping Over Gaps: As a RISKY ACTION,
a model can jump across a gap of up to half their
movement characteristic (measured horizontally).
This costs movement as normal and can be taken as
any kind of movement that the model has. A model
cannot attempt to jump a gap that it does not have
enough movement to clear. If this RISKY ACTION
fails, the model falls as if it fell from a ledge on either
side of the gap of the opponent’s choice.
; Jumping Between Ledges of Unequal Heights:
If the ledge that the model is jumping to is lower
than the ledge that it is jumping from, apply the
rules for Jumping Down after the model jumps the
gap. If the ledge that the model is jumping to is
higher than the ledge that it is jumping from, it can
only be up to 1” higher and, if that ledge is at least
½” higher, the jump costs an extra 1” of movement.
; Jumping Down: A model can voluntarily ‘fall’
from a ledge that it is in base contact with. This
never costs movement and can be done as part of
any movement that the model has. Additionally,
when falling from heights of up to 3” in this way, it
does not make an injury roll.
Falling
When a model falls, it is moved from its current position
to the first space that it can occupy directly beneath it or
the ledge that it fell from. If it fell from a height greater
than 2”, it must roll on the Injury Chart. For every 3”
fallen, add +1 DICE to this injury roll (for example, a
fall of 3” would be rolled with +1 DICE and a fall of 6”
with +2 DICE).
A model can fall through its own action, such as when
it fails a RISKY ACTION when jumping over gaps
or when jumping down a distance greater than 3”. A
model in an elevated position may also fall when it is
Downed while within 1” of a ledge. When this happens,
the model takes an ACTION. If it succeeds, the model
remains Downed where it is. If it fails, the model falls
from the nearest ledge.
Model Accuracy
When it comes to making
sure the models in your game
match their stated size, actual
equipment, weapons and armour,
we recommend the following
maxim:
“Be strict with yourself but
lenient with others”.

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Terrain
There are four types of terrain in Trench Crusade: Open,
Difficult, Dangerous and Impassable.
; Open: Open terrain is the most common terrain
is Trench Crusade. Models can move freely through
Open terrain. This includes crossing obstacles of up
to 1” high, which does not cost movement. Ladders
and ramps are open terrain.
; Difficult: This includes rock beds, swamps,
barbed wire and so on. Moving through Difficult
Terrain costs double the normal movement of the
model.
; Dangerous: This includes barbed wire,
minefields, raging fires, areas covered in poisonous
gas and so on. Whenever a model moves into, or
starts its Activation in, Dangerous Terrain, it must
take an ACTION. On a failure, make an injury
roll for the model. If the model moved into the
Dangerous Terrain, this ACTION is RISKY.
; Impassable: Models cannot pass through
Impassable terrain.
Terrain can be both Difficult and Dangerous.
Movement types
There exist two movement types currently in Trench
Crusade: Infantry and Flying. A model can only have
one movement type. If it gains a movement of another
type, it must choose which movement it keeps.
; Infantry: This movement type covers every
model that walks, crawls or gallops along the
ground. Models with this movement type obey all of
the typical rules for movement.
; Flying: This movement type covers every
model that flies with wings, floats with magic or
otherwise hovers above the ground. Flying models
treat Difficult and/or Dangerous Terrain as Open
Terrain and they do not trigger mines and similar
devices. Flying models can climb up and down and
they can jump over gaps of up to their Movement
characteristic without taking ACTIONS.
Combat
Combat is divided into Ranged and Melee Combat. A
model may fight in Melee Combat or with any ranged
weapons it has.
Ranged Attacks
To shoot at an enemy, a model must have a ranged
weapon and be able to see the target. If the model has
multiple ranged weapons, you can shoot one of them per
Activation. The only way to check what your model can
see is to stoop over the tabletop for a model’s eye view for
actual line of sight.
Models in Melee combat cannot shoot unless the rules
of the weapon indicate otherwise. Some indirect fire
weapons have rules that allow you to target models even
out of sight – these are clearly explained in the profile for
such weapons. Models can see all around themselves (i.e.
360°) and they may be turned freely to face any direction
before firing.
When making a ranged attack follow these steps:
1. Choose one Ranged Weapon ACTION, declare a
   target and check line of sight.
2. Check if the target is in range of the weapon.
3. Determine and apply any +/- DICE that affect
   the shot.
4. Roll on the Action Success Chart as standard.
5. If you hit the enemy, roll on the Injury Chart (see
   below). Determine and apply any +/- DICE that
   affect the injury roll.
6. If the weapon can shoot multiple times per
   Activation, resolve the shots one at a time.
   Modifiers
   ; Enemy behind Cover: Add -1 DICE to the
   roll. A model is in cover whenever it is in contact
   with a piece of scenery that is at least as long as the
   model’s base. If an attacker can see a model in its
   entirety, this penalty does not apply. A model cannot
   gain cover merely from being obscured due to angles,
   distant scenery or the surface that they are standing
   on (such as when standing on top of a building).
   ; Long Range: If the target is more than half the
   weapon’s maximum range, add -1 DICE to the
   roll to determine if the attack hits.
   ; Shooting from an elevated position: Add +1
   DICE to hit rolls if the model is taking the shot from
   a position more than 2” above the target’s ground
   level (being the floor on which the target’s base rests
   on). If the target is on a 50mm or larger base, the
   height must be 4” from the target’s ground level.
   Shooting into Melee
   If you shoot at any models
   engaged in melee (from a position
   outside the melee itself ), roll a
   D6 for each shot (or automatic
   hit) to determine which model is
   hit: On a 1-3, the attack targets
   one of your models at random
   within 1” of the target, on a 4-6,
   the attack targets an enemy model
   at random within 1” of the target.
   Resolve the attack as normal once
   the target is determined.
   You are not allowed to shoot
   (unless otherwise noted) if
   engaged in melee yourself.

   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   Injury Chart
   If your attack hits the enemy, it is time to
   determine the amount of damage the attack has
   caused. Roll 2D6 (plus any +/-DICE from the
   model’s profile or other sources), pick the two
   highest (or lowest if any -DICE were applied)
   and consult the following table:
   1 (or less) No effect
   2-6 Minor Hit
   7-8 Down
   9+ Out of Action
   Note: On occasion, a rule will ask you to total
   more (or less) than 2D6 to determine the
   outcome of a roll. If the dice roll is modified by
   +/- DICE, modify the dice pool as normal and
   keep the highest or lowest number of dice equal
   to the number of dice in the starting dice pool.
   For example, if the rule asked you to roll a total
   of 3D6 with +1 DICE, you would roll four dice
   and keep and total the highest three dice.
   Modifiers to Injury Chart rolls (cumulative):
   ; Trench Shield: -1 to injury rolls (can be
   combined with any Armour)
   ; Standard Armour: -1 to injury rolls
   ; Reinforced Armour: -2 to injury rolls
   ; Machine Armour: -3 to injury rolls (not
   cumulative with a shield)
   ; TOUGH: If a TOUGH model would be
   taken Out Of Action, it is knocked Down
   instead. After a TOUGH model has been
   knocked Down in this way once, it can be
   taken Out of Action as normal.
   ; Target is Down: Add +1 DICE to the
   dice pool when determining injuries for a
   model that is Down.
   ; Bloodbath: Roll an additional D6
   and add it to the injury roll total. Costs six
   BLOOD MARKERS (three if the target is
   Down).
   No Effect
   The armour of the target withstands the hit.
   There is no effect.
   Minor Hit
   Add +1 BLOOD MARKER next to the model to
   represent a wound. Use the dice pips to count the
   hits inflicted (maximum six per model).
   Whenever the wounded model takes an
   ACTION, the opponent can decide to spend one
   or more of the BLOOD MARKERS to add -1
   DICE to the roll for each of them (i.e. roll 3D6
   and pick the two lowest results if you use one
   marker).
   When rolling on the Injury Chart against this
   model, the opponent can spend one or more of
   the BLOOD MARKERS to add +1 DICE to the
   roll for each pip. This makes a severe injury more
   likely. When you attack a wounded model, you
   can spend one or more of the markers to add +1
   DICE to the attack roll for each marker.
   Warrior Down!
   Place +1 BLOOD MARKER next to the model
   and the model goes Down. If the model is already
   Down, it instead suffers +2 BLOOD MARKERS
   and remains Down. A model that is Down suffers
   a -1 DICE penalty to all of its ACTIONS. Also
   it cannot move during its Activation through its
   own ACTIONS.
   The Down condition can either be represented
   by placing an indicator next to the model (such
   as a scrap of paper) or by physically turning the
   model face-down on its side. A model turned
   on its side will present a different profile for
   Line-of-Sight targeting, but these two methods
   of indication are otherwise identical and the
   model’s controller may decide which to use.
   At the start of its own Activation, a Downed
   warrior can Stand, but any movement (Move,
   Dash, Charge, Jump, Climb etc.) it can take is
   halved. If a model is Downed during its own
   Activation, it may attempt a RISKY ACTION in
   order to Stand. Otherwise, it remains Down for
   the remainder of its Activation.
   Out of Action
   The warrior suffers a major wound and is out
   of the game for the rest of the battle – remove
   the model from the table. Resolve what has
   happened to the model after the battle as
   explained in the Serious Injuries section of the
   rules.

   An activated model can use any of its Melee ACTIONS
   if it is in contact with (i.e. within 1” of ) one or more
   enemies. Select any melee weapon or attack action
   available to the model – these are clearly indicated in the
   characteristics of each weapon entry.
1. Declare which melee action you are taking and
   what opposing model you are targeting.
2. Roll on the Action Success Chart using any
   melee attacks available to the model. Add any +/-
   DICE from any source such as BLOOD MARKERS,
   profile of the warrior making the attack etc.
3. If the result is successful, roll on the Injury Chart
   to determine what happens to the target (unless
   some Equipment or Special Ability of the model
   indicates otherwise).
   Modifiers
   ; Defended obstacle: Add -1 DICE to the
   roll. The target of a melee attack is considered to
   be defending an obstacle if it is not Down, it is
   touching an obstacle, that obstacle is at least ½” high
   (measured from the target’s base) and that obstacle
   is between it and its attacker. Common examples of
   such obstacles are stone walls, earthen ramparts and
   trenches. Simple hedges, bushes or low fences are
   often not enough.
   ; Off-Hand Weapons: Add -1 DICE to the roll
   if the attack was made with an Off-Hand Weapon.
   Generally, each model can only attack once in melee, but
   some can execute multiple attacks due to their natural
   abilities or special weapons.
   Two Melee Weapons: A model armed with two melee
   weapons can take two separate Melee Attack ACTIONS,
   one with each weapon. One of these weapons,
   determined before you make your first ACTION roll,
   is an Off-Hand weapon. Off-Hand weapons suffer -1
   DICE to hit.
   If a STRONG model wields a two-handed melee weapon
   in one hand and a one-handed melee weapon in the
   other, the one-handed weapon is always regarded as
   the Off-Hand weapon. Resolve attacks made by a model
   wielding two melee weapons one at a time, with the OffHand weapon last.
   Moving in combat: If a model is in Melee combat at the
   start of their Activation, they may use their Standard
   Move ACTION while staying within 1” of the enemies
   they are engaged in combat with. This is most often
   used to negate the Defended Obstacle bonus. No roll is
   needed to do this.
   End of Activation
   Once you have moved the model and taken all
   ACTIONS you wish, or have failed with any of your
   RISKY ACTIONS, the Activation of the model ends and
   your opponent can now Activate one of their models.
   Keep Activating models as long as either player has any
   inactivated models left.
   Once you and your opponent have Activated all of your
   models once, go to the Morale Phase.
   Morale
   Your warband may abandon the battle if it suffers too
   many casualties. At the end of any Turn, when at least
   half of your warband is Down or Out of Action, roll on
   the Action Success Chart.
   If you fail, your warband flees the battlefield and loses
   the battle immediately. If both warbands are required to
   take this test, the smaller warband tests first.
   Optional Rule: A warband that loses a Morale Test can
   decide, instead of fleeing, that their warband is Shaken.
   Actions taken by models in a Shaken warband are
   considered RISKY ACTIONS.
   After one turn, the warband recovers to its normal state
   and is no longer considered Shaken. If it fails a Morale
   test again (shaken or not), it flees as standard.
   End of Turn
   Once both players have Activated all the models in their
   force once, the turn ends and a new turn begins. The
   player with the lowest number of models in their force
   starts the new turn and selects a model to activate.
   “Blessed are the warriors, for they
   shall bathe in the crimson rivers of
   victory.”

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  K
  eywords define the core abilities, rules,
  troop types and damage categories in the
  game. Each of them is shared by several
  models/weapons/equipment and are
  called out with a Keyword. This makes it
  easy for you to differentiate between descriptive terms
  and game rules. A model or a weapon may have multiple
  Keywords. Rules governing all Keywords in the game are
  listed here.
  +DICE: Modifier for ACTION rolls. For each +DICE,
  add one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are
  about to make. +1 DICE thus makes the roll a total of
  3D6. Then roll all the dice and pick the two highest.
  If two +DICE are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two
  highest, and so on.
  -DICE: Modifier for ACTION rolls. For each -DICE,
  add one dice to the dice pool of the 2D6 roll you are
  about to make. Thus -1 DICE makes the roll a total of
  3D6. Then roll all the dice and pick the two lowest. If
  two -DICE are added, roll 4D6 and pick the two lowest,
  and so on.
  ACTION: Covers attacking with Melee and Ranged
  Weapons, Dashing and any other activity where the
  player must roll on the Action Success Chart to make
  an Action. This roll can be modified by the opposing
  player by using BLOOD MARKERS. Each marker causes
  -1 DICE penalty to the roll.
  ARTIFICIAL: This model is not of natural origin but is
  instead constructed from non-organic elements.
  ASSAULT: Ranged attacks made with weapons that have
  this Keyword do not prevent a model from charging
  during the same activation. A charge may only be made
  if a single ranged attack is made with a weapon with this
  Keyword, regardless of any other rules that the weapon
  might have.
  BLACK GRAIL: This model is part of the Black Grail
  faction.
  BLAST (X): A weapon with BLAST (X) has an area
  of effect with a radius of inches indicated by X. If this
  weapon targets a model, this radius is measured from
  the centre of that model’s base in all directions. If this
  weapon targets a point on the ground, this radius is
  measured from that point in all directions, including
  vertically. If the Attack ACTION with this weapon is
  successful, it hits every model within this radius that the
  target (either model or point) has line of sight to (i.e. not
  completely blocked by terrain).
  BLESSING MARKER: Supernatural or chemical
  temporary enhancement. Each marker can be converted
  into +1 DICE for any ACTION the model takes, or into
  -1 DICE when rolling injuries for this model.
  BLOOD MARKER: Damage inflicted by attacks. Each
  can be converted into -1 DICE for any ACTION the
  wounded model takes or into +1 DICE when rolling
  injuries for this model.
  CONSUMABLE: An item with this keyword can only be
  used once. After the battle, any items with this keyword
  that were used are lost.
  CRITICAL: When attacking with a weapon with this
  keyword, add +2 DICE (instead of 1) to any injury rolls
  the weapon causes if you roll a Critical (i.e. 12+) on the
  Action Success Chart.
  CUMBERSOME: Model always requires two hands to
  use this weapon, even if the model has the Keyword
  STRONG. A weapon with the Keyword CUMBERSOME
  ignores this restriction when benefitting from the Shield
  Combo rule.
  DEMONIC: The model is supernaturally tainted by Hell
  and is vulnerable to holy powers.
  ELITE: The most senior and heroic models of the
  warband. They have different rules for experience and
  advancement, and often enjoy a different weapon,
  armour and equipment selection.
  FEAR: Enemies of models with this Keyword suffer -1
  DICE in melee combat against this model. Some units
  are immune to this effect. Models that cause FEAR are
  not affected by FEAR themselves.
  FIRE: A model hit by a weapon with this Keyword
  suffers a BLOOD MARKER in addition to any other
  Keywords
  K
  13
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  effects of the attack. The model suffers this BLOOD
  MARKER even if the attack has no other effects or is
  otherwise negated. Some equipment or abilities can
  negate the additional BLOOD MARKER caused by this
  Keyword.
  FIRETEAM: This model is part of a Fireteam made up
  of two models. All models that are part of this Fireteam
  can be activated at the same time without the opponent
  getting their turn in between. They can take their
  ACTIONS in any order they wish, switching between the
  two models. Note that if the activation of either member
  of the Fireteam forcefully ends (due to a failed RISKY
  ACTION for example), it ends both Activations. Allies
  cannot be part of a Fireteam.
  GAS: A model hit by a weapon with this Keyword suffers
  a BLOOD MARKER, in addition to any other effects of
  the attack. The model suffers this BLOOD MARKER even
  if the attack has no other effects or is otherwise negated.
  Some equipment or abilities can negate the additional
  BLOOD MARKER caused by this Keyword.
  GOLEM: This model is a Golem, constructed from lost
  Kabbalistic knowledge – and it is exceedingly hard to
  destroy. It treats Out of Action injury results as Down
  unless the attack is made using the Bloodbath rule, in
  which case an Out of Action result removes the model
  from play as standard. It does not suffer additional
  BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with the Keyword
  GAS and is not affected by the Keyword FEAR. The
  controlling player cannot remove BLOOD MARKERS
  from the Golem by any means, though the opponent can
  use them as standard.
  GRENADE: Grenade-type weapons ignore penalties for
  cover and long range. They do not count towards the
  number of ranged weapons a model can carry and do not
  have to be held in your hand at all times. A model armed
  with grenades can use them as many times as they wish.
  HEAVY: If carrying a weapon, armour or equipment with
  this Keyword, the model cannot move/dash and shoot
  during its Activation, and the model cannot roll D6 and
  add it to the Charge move. A model can only carry one
  item with this Keyword.
  HERETIC: The model is a member of the Heretic Legion
  faction.
  INFILTRATOR: Models with this Keyword can be
  deployed anywhere on the table out of line of sight
  of any enemies, but at least 8” away from the closest
  enemy. They are deployed after all other models without
  this Keyword. If any infiltrators cannot be deployed
  according to these restrictions then those models can
  always be placed in your deployment zone. If a scenario
  does not allow for infiltrators, deploy models with this
  Keyword during standard deployment as if they didn’t
  have this Keyword.
  LEADER: As long as this model is not taken Out of
  Action, add +1 DICE to any Morale tests the
  warband has to take.
  LIMIT (X): You can only purchase as many of this
  piece of equipment/weapon/armour as indicated by
  the number in parenthesis for your warband. If you find
  more via looting/exploration, you can break this limit.
  NEW ANTIOCH: This model is part of the New Antioch
  faction.
  PILGRIM: This model is part of the Pilgrim faction.
  RISKY ACTION: If you fail your roll on the Action
  Success Chart when taking this ACTION, the Activation
  of this model ends immediately.
  SHRAPNEL: A model hit by a weapon with this
  Keyword suffers a BLOOD MARKER, in addition to
  any other effects of the attack. The model suffers this
  BLOOD MARKER even if the attack has no other effects
  or is otherwise negated. Some equipment or abilities can
  negate the additional BLOOD MARKER caused by this
  Keyword.
  SKIRMISHER: When a model with this Keyword is
  targeted by an enemy’s Charge, it may immediately
  move D3” in any direction, except into Melee Combat.
  A Skirmisher may also make this move when a charging
  enemy model would enter Melee Combat with it during
  a Charge that is not targeting it. After either of these
  moves is resolved, the Charge continues as normal
  toward the original target. These moves can only be
  taken if the Skirmisher is not in Melee Combat and only
  one such move may be taken per Charge.
  STRONG: A model with this Keyword ignores the rules
  for weapons/armour/equipment with Keyword HEAVY,
  including not being limited to carrying only one HEAVY
  item (though other limitations apply as normal). In
  addition, it may use a single two-handed Melee weapon
  as a one-handed weapon.
  SULTANATE: This model is part of the Iron Sultanate
  faction.
  THE COURT: This model is part of The Court of the
  Seven Headed Serpent faction.
  TOUGH: If a TOUGH model would be taken Out Of
  Action, it is knocked Down instead. After a TOUGH
  model has been knocked Down in this way once, it can
  be taken Out of Action as normal.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  T
  n this part of the book, we will take a
  detailed look at each warband and provide
  the information you need to recruit one.
  Choose Your Faction
  Each warband in Trench Crusade belongs to a faction
  fighting in the Great War. Use the faction lists that
  follow to recruit and equip your warband. These lists
  provide information about the troop types available,
  their weapons, armour and equipment options, as well as
  special rules specific to that faction.
  Note: Most warbands have Variant Lists which you can
  use instead of the main list. These are listed as part of
  the Warband List entry and they detail how the variant
  differs from the core list.
  Recruit Your Warband
  Once you have selected your faction (and possible
  Variant), you have 700 ducats to spend on your initial
  warband. Each model and their equipment (if you
  choose to buy any) costs a set amount of money. As you
  make your choices, subtract the money you have “spent”
  from your total until you have bought all you can. Any
  unspent ducats are put into the warband’s strongbox
  and can be used later or hoarded to buy something more
  expensive.
  Some items, weapons and armour cost Glory Points
  instead of ducats to acquire them. Glory Points are
  earned by performing valorous deeds in battle. Refer
  to the section on Glory for details. Generally warbands
  don’t have access to Glory Points when they are created,
  so these purchases usually happen later on in the
  campaign.
  Each warband list details what troops are available to
  you and in what numbers. Most lists include a model
  they must have when the warband is created, usually
  representing its commanding officer. Otherwise you
  are allowed to purchase as many or as few warriors as
  you wish. We recommend that the weapons, armour
  and equipment you choose for your warriors should be
  represented on the models themselves to make it easier
  for you and your opponents to play the game.
  Keywords
  Some troop types, weapons and pieces of equipment
  have Keywords that give them special abilities, or denote
  them to be part of a group of models where certain rules
  apply to all models with the same Keyword. See the
  section on Keywords for details.
  Limitations
  Some armaments are more limited in supply. They may
  have the following Keywords that limit their availability.
  These limitations are shown in the warband lists as
  follows:
  ; LIMIT (x): If the piece of equipment has a
  Keyword LIMIT, then your warband cannot have
  more than the set number of this type of weapon,
  armour or equipment. For example, if a Weapon
  has Keyword LIMIT (2), then your warband can
  purchase a maximum of two such weapons. If you
  lose any of these weapons during the campaign, you
  can buy replacements with available funds up to a
  maximum of two.
  ; ELITE only: Some weapons, armour or
  equipment are only usable by troops with the
  ELITE Keyword. You cannot give them to troops
  without the ELITE Keyword even if you acquire
  extras during a campaign.
  Equipment
  Unless otherwise stated in the rules, each warrior may
  carry the following:
  ; One two-handed ranged weapon OR
  ; Up to two one-handed ranged weapons.
  Starting a Warband
  I When it comes to making sure the
  models in your game match their
  actual equipment and weapons,
  we recommend the following
  maxim:
  “Be strict with yourself but
  lenient with others.”
  15
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  In addition, they may carry:
  ; One two-handed melee weapon OR
  ; Up to two single-handed melee weapons.
  You may buy additional equipment between battles
  or acquire new weapons during a campaign, and freely
  change the equipment, weapons and armour of your
  fighters unless otherwise noted in their warband list
  entry. You must still obey the limitations as explained in
  the rules when it comes to changing the armaments of
  your models.
  Some models come equipped with set weapons and
  armour when purchased, whilst some models may not
  change their loadout at all. All these cases are clearly
  indicated in the rules.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Allies & Mercenaries
  During the campaign you will have a chance to obtain
  Glory Points which can be used to purchase powerful
  troops and famous warriors known as Allies. These
  will add both numbers and specialist abilities to your
  warband. They cannot be purchased with ducats – the
  only way to attract their services is to perform glorious
  deeds on the battlefield!
  Allies fight alongside your warband, but they do not
  benefit or suffer from any special rules or restrictions
  that your warband might have. For example, a
  mercenary’s equipment never counts toward the LIMIT
  for any of the items that they have. Additionally, a Sin
  Eater (a mercenary available to the Heretic Legions)
  would not be affected by the Trench Ghost’s unique
  rules such as Slow and Undead Fortitude. If a rule is
  capable of affecting Allies, it will explicitly state so.
  Purchasable Abilities
  Some warbands allow you to purchase optional abilities
  for your models, such as the Goetic Powers of the Court
  of the Seven-headed Serpent. Unless otherwise specified,
  you can only ever buy one copy of any of these abilities
  for a single model. The same applies to bonuses gained
  from equipment, such as Martyrdom pills.
  Roster
  You’ll need a warband roster sheet to record the details
  of your warband. Blank roster sheets can be found
  printed at the back of this book and we offer a free
  digital version of the roster sheet at trenchcrusade.com.
  When you choose a warband, take a warband roster
  sheet and write down the details of each trooper in
  the appropriate place. It is a good idea to work out the
  warband on a piece of scrap paper first, as you will have
  to juggle the weapons and fighters to get as close to the
  maximum permitted value of the warband as possible.
  If you have any cash left after choosing your warband
  write this down in the space marked Strongbox. You will
  need to give your warband a name as well as name all
  your Elites and all your common troopers. It’s up to you
  to invent suitable names, though you’ll find plenty of
  inspiration throughout this book.
  Ready for Battle
  Your warband is now ready. The Great War awaits!
  Characteristics Profile
  The characteristics of each model are described in
  their profile. You will find profiles for all models in the
  appropriate faction list. The information found on the
  profiles is described here.
  Model name
  The name of the model is recorded first in any profile.
  Movement
  The distance in inches which the model may move on
  the battlefield each time it is activated.
  Ranged
  This number indicates how many +/- DICE the model
  adds to its attack roll when using any ranged weapons.
  The higher the number, the more skilled a warrior is
  when using ranged weapons.
  Melee
  This number indicates how many +/- DICE the model
  adds to its attack roll when making a melee attack. The
  higher the number, the more skilled a model is.
  Armour
  Indicates how well-armoured the model is. This number
  is subtracted from the roll on the Injury Chart when the
  model is wounded.
  Base
  Indicates the size of the base the model is mounted on.
  Equipment
  This entry lists the equipment, weapons and armour the
  model is carrying, as well as what options for acquiring
  additional gear it may have.
  Abilities
  If the model has any unique special abilities not covered
  by the standard rules, they will be described here.
  Keywords
  Any Keywords the model has will be listed here. These
  include troop types as well as the most common abilities
  shared between multiple troop types, each identified by
  the identical Keyword. The Keywords section explains
  the rules for each of them.

  Heretic Legion
  shroud of darkness blankets the world.
  Smoke and brimstone spews from the
  yawning gates of Inferno, enveloping the
  lands where people have abandoned God
  and openly wage war against His Creation.
  It is a grim reality that a full third of humanity has bent
  its knee before the idols of Hell. The main military force
  of Satan on Earth is the Heretic Legions, raised from
  amongst these citizens of the damned.
  Under special absolution from the Cardinal Protector,
  many spies have been dispatched into Hell’s domains
  over the years. Most are caught, never to be seen again,
  save for some whose eternally screaming heads are
  returned to New Antioch, branded with bleeding runes
  that mock the Holy Trinity.
  Against all odds some do make it back to the light,
  whispering of the horrors they have witnessed: of
  firstborn cast into the mouths of the burning statues
  of Baal and human flesh sold by the pound in dreadful
  markets. They speak of the great idols of the Golden
  Calf and rapturous men and women who prostrate
  themselves before them, carving off strips of their own
  flesh in ecstatic offering. Inverted pyramids and towers
  descend into the depths of these cities, built of iron and
  black stone. Within these pits stand sacrificial altars
  where weeping captives are slowly sliced to death over
  agonising days and weeks with wicked knives made of
  infernal basalt. Cathedrals dedicated to the Princes of
  Hell hang from great arches of volcanic stone, while
  condemned are crucified on hundreds of upside-down
  crosses.
  Accounts speak of sprawling factories made of
  mutilated flesh and metal, their forges yielding endless
  munitions for the ongoing war. Guided by the teachings
  of Tartarus’ smiths, alchemists toil over colossal weapons
  and armoured behemoths, wielding the forbidden
  secrets of their patrons’ metallurgy to forge instruments
  of death and suffering beyond the grasp of any human
  engineer. These are once-proud cities of Earth, where
  churches have been toppled and entire populations are
  now dedicated towards bringing down the very Throne
  “We are no longer supplicating
  weaklings trembling before an
  unmerciful God. We say: Blessed
  are the mighty-minded, for they
  shall ride the whirlwinds.”
- Ramman, Anointed of the XXI
  Heretic Legion ‘Widowmakers’
  of Heaven.
  Amongst the forsaken citizens enduring within Hell’s
  earthly domains, the greatest status is afforded to those
  who fight in the Great War. Most do this as Heretic
  Troopers who serve their liege lords in lieu of tribute. To
  join the army of damnation as a full-fledged Legionnaire
  is no easy feat. Those who wish to win a place amongst
  the Heretic Legions must make an unholy pilgrimage
  to the burning bronze gates of Hell where the infernal
  heat, felt from leagues away, sears both flesh and spirit
  until the torment becomes unbearable. Along the Valley
  of Tears, the great road that leads to the gate is paved
  with wailing souls and lamentations and littered with
  endless mounds of charred bodies. Many are still halfalive, writhing in agony, trapped in a grotesque twilight
  between life and death, their wickedness deemed
  insufficient. These discarded souls are doomed to suffer
  until the Day of Judgement.
  Those who make it within sight of Hell’s Maw are
  considered worthy and are initiated into the Legions,
  taking unbreakable vows that chain them into darkness
  for all eternity, their bodies branded with the mark of
  the Devil Lord that has claimed them. Armouries of
  Hell equip them for battle and Heretic Priests beckon
  forth new supplicants as dictated by the whispers of their
  patron Archdevils. Thus a new Heretic Legionnaire is
  born. They hail Archdevils as their masters and are thus
  damned for all eternity.
  There are some who push further on, to the Gate itself
  and beyond. Their very flesh ignites, never to recover,
  but those with the blackest souls can enter Inferno
  itself. Amongst those the Anointed are especially
  revered amongst the Legions. They are the paragons of
  unhinged brutality – men and women of colossal vigour
  and unyielding devotion. Having tread the accursed
  path to the shores of the Lake of Eternal Flame, where
  the damned wither and contort in ceaseless torment,
  the Anointed emerge forever scarred by the embrace
  of abyssal fires. The blackened and burnt flesh of the
  Anointed will never heal, but in exchange they are
  granted the right to wear Heavy Gehenna armoured

  suits and they gain strength to wield weapons that a
  normal man could barely lift. It is said that to gaze into
  their eyes is to glimpse the flames of Hell, forever etched
  in their vision.
  Yet some who witness go even further in their
  depraved devotion. Suicide is a mortal sin and one
  eagerly embraced by many. Most cry out for devils to
  notice their final sacrifice in vain, as the Infernal nobles
  are capricious and delight in betraying their own as
  much as their enemies. But those with truly wicked
  and depraved souls are resurrected in contempt of the
  Redeemer, coming back as Choristers, horrific mockeries
  of Creation whose severed heads sing unholy hymns
  praising the Devil, their voices causing the ears of their
  enemies to bleed.
  Though the vast bulk of the Heretic Legions are made
  of mortal humans, Hell often sends their own abhorrent
  progeny to reinforce their mortal foot soldiers:
  nightmarish War Beasts made of captured and possessed
  creatures and dreaded Artillery Witches who act as
  mobile artillery supporting lighting assaults. Thus, in
  this accursed theatre of war, mortals and abominations
  march hand in withering hand, bound by the suffering
  ties of damnation. The wails of tortured beasts meld
  with the shrieks of damned souls, while the skies rain
  down fiery retribution upon all who dare to oppose the
  Heretics’ ceaseless crusade for a demented parity with
  their Creator.
  Warband Creation
  You have 700 ducats to recruit your initial Force in the

  Heretic Special Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Heretic Warband.
  Sacrificial Knife
  Terrifying blades blessed by the hand of a greater devil, these knives are used in Heretic rituals to sacrifice captives to the
  dark powers of Hell. They simply need to touch their opponents to cause indescribable pain and even the slightest wound
  often proves fatal. They are risky even to their wielders, as the merest scratch wounds friend and a foe alike.

  0-1 Heretic Chorister (Cost: 65 Ducats)
  Suicide is a Mortal Sin, and sacrificing yourself to the glory of Hell is a yet greater affront
  to God. Some Heretics born with a gift of sonorous voice but little prospects of rising
  through the ranks but possessing a determination to excel may pursue the dark path of
  becoming a Chorister.
  Such supplicants go to one of the black altars of Heretic abodes at the bottom of the deep
  inverted pyramid temples dedicated to the greatest of Arch-devils. There they are dressed
  in the robes of dark devotion, lie on the altar and mutilate themselves to death by
  carving unholy runes into their flesh. The more wounds they can suffer before perishing,
  the more pleasing it is said their offering is. The most devout slice their own throats,
  trying to cut as deep as they can before their miserable life leaves them.
  Most such wretches go to their doom in the Lake of Fire, but some are reborn as
  Choristers after nine days. Their corpses lurch back to their feet, and finish their grisly
  beheading, and lift their severed heads that begin to sing hymns they have learned in the
  Inferno. From their self-inflicted wounds spurts cold blood that forms diabolic symbols
  and changes to match the words of their unholy chorale. They head towards the front
  lines driven by a call no living can hear and join the Heretic warband of their choosing.
  As their severed heads sing their agonising hymns, the minds of their enemies are filled
  with visions from the Pits of Hell, weakening both the resolve and strength of those
  unfortunate enough to hear the dire song of a Chorister. Their hymns are often the first
  thing a fresh recruit experiences on the battlefield, as their unholy voice rolls across the
  trenches, proclaiming a never-ending prophecy of the final victory of Hell over Heaven.

  Artillery Witches stalk the battlefields, hurling ordnance assembled in the death factories
  of Hell’s Third Circle. They are completely mute and no one has ever seen their faces. Some
  question if they are even living, and there are tales that they too were manufactured in
  Hell. They can pull an infinite number of Infernal Bombs from a portal to Hell that they
  manifest at will, summoning them to their hands from a gate of midnight blackness.

  any melee weapon, armour or equipment from the Heretic Legion Armoury.
  Abilities
  ; Infernal Bomb: This wicked infernal weapon is treated as a one-handed
  Ranged weapon with the Keyword BLAST 3”. Specify a 1x1mm point on the
  battlefield within 36” that the Witch can see and that you want to target. Next,
  make a Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less with the two
  lowest Dice), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location, multiplied by the
  number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bomb
  lands 2” away, as 7 - 5 = 2). The direction is decided by your opponent. Roll on the
  Injury Chart for each model within the BLAST radius.
  If the bomb lands exactly on top of any model, roll with 3D6 on the Injury Chart
  and add the dice together! Other models hit by the bomb roll on the Injury Chart
  as standard. Any model hit, but not taken Out of Action, by this attack is blown
  D3” directly away from the point of impact (roll for each model separately),
  stopping if they hit other models, buildings or objects. This attack has the Keyword
  SHRAPNEL and therefore causes an additional +1 BLOOD MARKER. Cover, range
  and higher position do not affect attacks by the Infernal Bomb. Roll injuries for
  models that would benefit from Cover from the perspective of the BLAST point
  with -1 DICE. The Activation of the Witch ends immediately after using the
  Infernal Bomb.
  ; Artificial Life: Artillery Witches are not affected by FEAR. Additionally,
  attacks with the Keyword GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure the Witch and

  (Your warband may include any number of Wretched as long as they are outnumbered

  Many unfortunates fall into the hands of the Heretic warbands, either during one of their
  many raids or battles, or purchased from the slave markets within their own territories.
  Some are foolhardy adventurers who travel into the domains of the damned only to be
  caught by their watchful patrols.
  Their lot is grim and terrible. They are worked to death in the factories of Sixty-Six Lords,
  butchered for meat, or worst of all, sold or offered to the agents of the Court of the SevenHeaded Serpent to be used as raw power for Goetic Spells.
  Yet one path to freedom exists: they can volunteer to serve in the Legions as the lowest of
  low, the most disposable of penal troops. For the law of Hell is clear: those who rebel against
  God can gain their freedom if they are deemed to have performed sufficiently great deeds.
  Thus it is no wonder that many Heretic warbands drive swarms of the Wretched ahead of
  them to blunt and slow down the enemy assaults.
  Wretched are branded with cursed flesh-eating tattoos as a safeguard against escape and
  heavily drugged to degrade and dull their will, while still leaving their aggression intact.
  Heretic Elites discard the lives of the Wretched carelessly, as their sacrifice on the battlefield
  counts as a worthy deed which will be rewarded by their Patrons.

Warband Variant: Heretic
Naval Raiding Party
The Heretic Fleet operates as a semi-autonomous entity
under the command of its High Captain and other
admirals. The Heretics have their own marine infantry
that often operates in small bands, striking deep behind
enemy lines and executing smash and grab missions.
They are always on the lookout for captives, loot,
information, supplies, rare artefacts and any opportunity
to express their cruelty and brutality. They are picked
from amongst the best soldiers of the Heretic Legions,
and have access to equipment and weapons gained from
past battles and terrible atrocities they have committed.
Special rules
The Heretic Naval Raiding Party has the following
special rules:
; Fast as Lightning: All Models have +1 DICE
when taking their Dash ACTIONS.
; Close Assault Weapons: The warband can buy
Submachine Guns for 25 ducats per weapon.
; Light Troops: The force may only include 0-1
Annointed and 0-1 Artillery Witch.
; Let Sleeping Dogs Lie: The warband may not
include a War Wolf.
; Unseen Advance: Up to three models
without ELITE Keyword can be upgraded into
INFILTRATORS at the cost of 10 ducats per Model.
Warband Variant:
Trench Ghosts
Sometimes when Heretic troopers die upon a hallowed
ground or in presence of an uncorrupted holy relic, they
become trapped between planes of existence. Claimed
by neither Heaven nor Hell, the Trench Ghosts become
Undead – doomed to fight a war without an end,
attacking both the Faithful and Heretic alike, hating all
life, obeying commands that no living can hear. Their
greed for worldly wealth and items of power remains
undiminished, and their semi-corporeal bodies are
exceedingly difficult to destroy. Their faces, covered
with gas masks they no longer have any use for, betray
nothing of the agony they endure. In close combat they
whisper of the agony of their existence and the pain of
their doom which will never give them rest, their broken
bodies and shattered minds forced to endure the horrors
of war for all eternity. Few can withstand such terror
without breaking.
Tales are told of many Trench Ghost Warbands that
haunt No Man’s Land, but the most famous are the
Ghosts of Tannenberg, shades of the Heretic force that
won the battle of Tannenberg but after sacking the
Church of St. Jacob passed into the shadow.
Special rules
The Trench Ghosts have the following special rules:
; Horror: All models in the Warband cause FEAR.
; Semi-corporeal: Any Ranged attacks against all
models in the Trench Ghost Warband roll injuries
with -1 DICE – the undead are hard to kill with
bullets! Melee Attacks do not suffer this penalty.
; Spectral: All models in the warband ignore
movement penalties caused by Difficult Terrain,
though they cannot move through any objects/
terrain. Dangerous terrain affects them as normal.
; Undead: All models in the Trench Ghost
warband do not suffer additional BLOOD MARKERS
from attacks with the Keyword GAS.
; Enemies of All: Trench Ghosts cannot use
Mercenaries.
; Lost Souls: Since only mortals who have souls
become ghosts, this warband may not have any
model with the Keyword ARTIFICIAL, such as
War Wolves or Artillery Witches. In addition, no
model in the warband may have a Hellbound Soul
Contract or an Infernal Brand Mark. Any model
that has one of these pieces of equipment in their
base profile will not have it, although its price stays
the same.
; Slow: All models in Trench Ghost warband have
a half Dash distance (i.e. 3”), and they suffer -1
DICE to all attacks against models Retreating from

TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES

; Sarcophagus Mine: At the cost of +30
ducats, up to two of the Troopers can be turned
into Sarcophagus Mines. They gain an armour
characteristic of -3, but can carry no other weapons
or any other items from the Armoury. In addition,
whenever an enemy comes within 3” of the Mine,
you can trigger a detonation as described below.
Alternatively, you can forgo this and explode the
mine during your own Activation of the model with
a successful RISKY ACTION with +1 DICE.
; When detonated, the mine explosion
is treated as a BLAST 3” weapon targeting
the Sarcophagus model with Keyword
SHRAPNEL. Models within 1” of the model
hit by the explosion roll their injuries with +1
DICE. The Mine itself is taken Out of Action.
; Barbed Wire Banshee: Instead of a Chorister,
a Trench Ghost warband may include a Barbed
Wire Banshee at the same cost. It has the same
characteristics as a Chorister with the usual Trench
Ghost special rules applied to it, but instead of the
Unholy Hymns ability the Banshee has Death Wail
as detailed below:
; Death Wail: All enemy models within 8”
of the Chorister suffer an additional +1 DICE
when any injury roll is made against them.
; Tank Palanquin: At the cost of 60 ducats, the
Heretic Priest of the warband can ride a ghostly
Tank Palanquin. This counts as Machine Armour
and the Priest riding it has a 50mm base, and counts
as being on a 2” high platform. While on a Tank
Palanquin, the Priest gains the Keyword STRONG.

Warband Variant:
Knights of Avarice
The warbands who follow the Prince of Greed call
themselves the Knights of Avarice. Such heretics display
their wealth extravagantly and prefer to carry the most
expensive and hard-to-acquire weapons, armour and
equipment, suffering none to join them who lacks
the means to obtain their glittering panoply. They are
festooned with chains of gold and the finest silk cloaks,
their armour is gilded with gold and decorated with
precious stones, and the handles of their great coin
hammers are made of the rarest of wood. Yet despite
the opulent wealth at display, their finery is tarnished
by the blood and soot that spews from the Hellgate,
and the delicate artistic filigree of their golden masks is
both terrible and beautiful in equal measure. In combat
they favour hammers and clubs that break the bones but
leave the flesh and blood intact, as well as poison gas and
highly accurate rifles. They scorn crude and destructive
fire or explosive weapons that could damage any objects
of value.
After the Knights of Avarice have claimed victory in
combat, they scour the battlefield or any settlement
they’ve conquered like a swarm of locusts. Anything and
everything of value is taken: metals from brass to bronze,
silver to gold, art objects, precious stones, livestock,
trade goods, rare tomes and scrolls… all are meticulously
catalogued and carried away by slaves and demonic
beasts of burden or great armoured cars that take the
stolen loot to the underground treasure chambers
which act as the temples of Mammon. Even the dead
are stripped of their flesh with the detached skill of
seasoned butchers, ready to be sold at market. Internal
organs taken from fallen victims are carefully preserved
in alchemical liquids to be sold to the scientists of the
infernal laboratories.
For the Heretics of the Path of Mammon hoarding
riches is not mere acquisition of wealth – it is their
religious compulsion. Ironically, they gain little
pleasure from their vast wealth, as their greed makes
them continuously desire ever greater riches. Thus
their warbands forever roam No Man’s Land, looking
for forgotten treasures or foes to dissect and turn into
wealth. For the greed of Mammon will never be sated.
Special rules
The Knights of Avarice have the following special rules:
; Worship Mammon: In a campaign, the patron
of the warband will always be Mammon. Instead of
the Puppet Master ability, the Heretic Priest of the
Knights of Avarice may select the Price of Greed
ability if they wish:
The Price of Greed: Worldly wealth belonging to the
target model of this curse starts crushing them under
its weight. Choose any model the Priest sees within
12” and take a RISKY ACTION. If successful, roll
immediately on the Injury Chart for that model and
add +1 DICE to the injury roll for each -1 Armour
modifier the model has (for example if the model
has a Trench Shield and standard armour, add +2
DICE to the injury rolls).
; Mammon’s Chosen: Knights of Avarice
allow only the wealthiest and the best-equipped
candidates to join their ranks. Your force may have
no models that cost less than 80 ducats (including
their equipment).
; Corrupt Merchants: Many merchants, traders
and moneylenders within the Faithful nations
are followers of Mammon and secretly supply the
Knights of Avarice with their wares. When creating
the warband, select one weapon, suit of armour or
other piece of equipment from the New Antioch
Armoury and one such item from the Iron Sultanate
Armoury. You can acquire this gear exactly as
the warband they come from. Any of these items
in question must not be already available to the
Heretic Warband. All the same limitations of the
original lists apply, so there is little point in taking an
Assassin’s Dagger (for example) since it can be only
used by Assassins. These two selected additions are
available to your warband throughout the campaign.
; Preserve the Loot: Knights of Avarice greatly
dislike using weapons that could damage the amount
of wealth that can be extracted from the fallen. No
weapon with the Keyword FIRE or SHRAPNEL can
be used by any model in this warband. In addition,
the Artillery Witches of this warband use Gas
Bombs: They have the Keyword GAS instead of
SHRAPNEL and they ignore armour. Injuries caused
by a direct hit are rolled with 2D6 and models
within a 3” blast radius are rolled with -1 DICE.
In a similar vein, their Grenade Launchers have the
GAS keyword instead of the SHRAPNEL keyword,
have a -1 D to injury rolls and ignore armour.
; Infernal Rivalry: Mammon is a rival of Beruth,
the great devil of wrath and murder, who is the
Patron of Death Commandos. Knights of Avarice
may include no Death Commandos.
; Goetic Warlocks: Goetic Warlocks are creations
of Mammon. This warband may include one for the
price of 110 ducats. This Warlock is still a mercenary
and obeys all of the rules associated with being a
mercenary (such as having fixed equipment and not
being able to be promoted to an ELITE throughout
the course of a campaign).
; Debtors to Mammon: Wretched of the warband
are not tied by Mammon’s Chosen rule.

Special Weapons & Equipment
Tarnished Armour 45 ducats
This suit of armour gilded with gleaming gold comes with a helmet often with a beautiful, cherub-like face warped or
corrupted in some way, such as with inhuman eyes or with the whole face twisted upside-down. Despite its splendour the
armour is always tarnished by blood, offal or other kind of corruption. Merely seeing it fills mortals with incredible greed
and makes the wearer an immediate target of their wrath as they attempt to tear it from them.
Rules: The suit counts as Reinforced Armour, a helmet and a gas mask. When an enemy declares a charge, they must
charge the model wearing this armour if it is visible, not in cover and within 12” of the wearer. The charging model
must be able to reach this model without climbing, leaping or crossing dangerous terrain. If the wearer of the armour
is already in melee combat, this power has no effect. LIMIT:1
Standard of Mammon 25 ducats
Battle Standards of Mammon are opulently decorated works of art, icons and banners done in mockery of the virtues
of Charity and Temperance. Always made of the most expensive materials, each is a unique work of dark genius, often
depicting saints performing vile sins or famous acts of Greed. It has the power to make anyone kneel before the Prince of
Greed.
Rules: Grants +1 DICE for all Morale tests as long as the model with the Flag is not Down or Out of Action.
Requires one hand to use as if it was a weapon, both in ranged and melee combat. Any enemy entering melee combat
with the model carrying this banner must make a successful ACTION or the model goes Down and cannot get up as
long as they are in melee combat with the bearer of the standard. LIMIT:1
Golden Calf Altar 20 ducats
This portable altar of Mammon creates illusions of immense wealth in any form its target covets above all. Overcome by
supernatural greed, those affected by the Curse of Mammon are forced to swoop down, feebly trying to pick up the objects of
their desire.
Rules: The area within 3” of the altar is Difficult Terrain for all models in the opposing Warband. This affects even
models that can Fly. The model carrying the altar may drop it at any point during their Activation. Once placed
down, the Golden Calf Altar cannot be picked up again. It has a 25mm base. HEAVY, CONSUMABLE, LIMIT:3
Coin Hammer 20 ducats
This double-handed hammer has the rune of mammon on its head. Its strikes leave a permanent, painful scar in the shape
of Mammon’s rune which burns through even the thickest armour. Mammon loves marking the innocent with his Rune,
as it sows mistrust amongst his enemies.

  “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no
  sign shall be given unto it, but the
  sign of the meta-christ.” A - Divinations 12:9
  s the war rages against the minions of
  Hell, strange visions torment the faithful
  across the globe. Men and women touched
  by Heaven are granted visions and
  Revelations are made by the messengers of
  God. Sisters of the Holy Orders are marked by Stigmata
  and take up the sword and the cross as instructed by
  angels. Those who have transgressed seek to atone for
  their sins by taking as many followers of the Devil with
  them to the afterlife.
  So they come, the mad and the maimed, the Godtouched and the guilt-ridden – all gathering around
  Prophets and Prophetesses, forming Trench Pilgrim
  Processions. These disorganised groups arm themselves
  and follow the prophets of the Lord unto the front
  lines. They fight with unrivalled zeal, hurling themselves
  against the Heretics, arming themselves with anything
  they can get their hands on from the oldest muskets to
  scourges and Molotov Cocktails.
  Pilgrims are not officially sanctioned by the Holy
  See of New Antioch, but the Church still blesses the
  crusades of the faithful. Thus the Pilgrim Processions
  are a common sight on the battlefields, often
  crossing No Man’s Land in suicidal assaults upon the
  Heretics, directed by the visions of their Prophets and
  Prophetesses who lead them, urged on by the whips of
  Castigators who are charged with instilling the Fear of
  God in their troops.
  The bulk of the Pilgrims are men and women with
  little military training, but when they don the Iron
  Capirote of a Trench Pilgrim, they can face even a
  demon from the deepest Bolgias of Hell unflinchingly.
  Nor is death necessarily an end to their mission:
  sometimes the Seventh Meta-Christ will deem a
  fallen pilgrim worthy and bring them back as MartyrPenitents: warriors half-way between Heaven and Earth,
  able to fight once more and feel no pain from bullet or
  bayonet thrust.
  Rarer and more dangerous are the Stigmatic Nuns,
  Holy Sisters who manifest wounds to match those of the
  Third Meta-Christ whom they venerate. They excel in
  close quarter combat, for each bleeding wound that they
  suffer makes them stronger, not weaker, as their devotion
  to suffering as their Lord once did gives them strength
  and endurance not found in common mortals. Armed
  with swords and pistols, they cross No Man’s Land
  heedless of any danger, praying to sustain wounds for the
  Redeemer which in turn will transform them into the
  very Vengeance of the Lord.
  In front of the Trench Pilgrims are driven the
  Ecclesiastic Prisoners – either captured enemies of the
  True Faith or volunteer sinners. Each is strapped with a
  high explosive which is detonated once they reach enemy
  lines. They dash across the killing grounds, hoping to
  somehow survive the blast and escape, or take as many
  followers of Lucifer with them as they can, depending on
  their convictions.
  The most puissant of Pilgrim Processions will be
  accompanied by a Shrine Anchorite, a metal behemoth
  some twelve feet tall, a living altar of war almost
  completely immune to any damage. The interior of the
  Anchorite is covered in spikes and barbed hooks so that
  the monk pilot is in a constant state of torment, rejoicing
  in their pain so they can suffer as their Lord once did.
  In combat they wield Adamantine Catherine Wheels of
  massive proportions which they use to crush sinners and
  heretics into a pulp, stringing them upon the wheel as a
  warning to others.
  There are a bewildering number and variety of Trench
  Pilgrim Processions: The Path of Pious Revenge swears
  in the name of St. Olga and uses flamethrowers, burning
  grenades and incendiary ammunition to assail the
  Heretics. The Pilgrims of the Iron Path follow St. Rita
  of Cascia and go to battle with hammers, mauls, maces
  and cudgels, and hammer nails into their heads in the
  memory of the saint they venerate. The Theban Legion
  of Rome carries the heads of the heretics upon their
  standards in the memory of their patron, St. Marice.
  They fight with swords and other blades, competing with
  each other for the number of heretic heads they amass.

  Trench Pilgrims Special Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Trench Pilgrim warband.
  Iron Capirote
  A conical helmet reminiscent of the headgear of the penitents. Blessed by the Church and often containing a fragment of a
  relic, Iron Capirotes shield their wearers from the psychological horror of war, enabling them to face creatures from the pits of
  Hell unflinchingly.
  Rules: Negates the additional BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with Keyword SHRAPNEL. Makes the model immune
  to the effects of FEAR.
  Molotov Cocktail
  Developed on the desperate Finnish battle frontier against the Ice Demons, this improvised weapon consists of a glass bottle
  containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture plus a source of ignition.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Molotov GRENADE 6” -1D to Injury FIRE, ASSAULT
  Rules: -1 DICE on injury rolls. Molotov Cocktails ignore all penalties for terrain/cover, as well as ignoring all armour
  on a Critical Attack roll.
  War Cross
  A War Cross (also known as a wurfkreuz in the Holy Roman Empire) is a four-pronged throwing weapon in the shape of a
  cross. It is engraved with prayers and psalms that guide it on an unerring path.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  War Cross - 8” No long-range penalty ASSAULT
  Rules: Does not count as one of the Ranged weapons carried by the model. Cannot be carried with Grenades. Ignores
  penalties for long range. A model with the weapon will not run out of them.
  Punt Gun
  A Punt Gun is an enormous shotgun loaded with up to 25 ounces of shot. It can be loaded with a risky amount of powder
  and square shot which causes widespread damage and destruction. It is a very popular weapon among Trench Pilgrims who
  lack access to conventional heavy weapons.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Punt Gun 2-handed 18” +1D to hit and to injure HEAVY, SHRAPNEL
  Rules: Owing to its high accuracy and lethal shot, a punt pun adds +1 DICE to all rolls to hit and to injury rolls.
  Before a model shoots with the punt gun, you can overcharge it with a shot, giving the weapon BLAST 3” radius. If
  you do this, the shooting ACTION with the Punt Gun always ends the shooter’s Activation and causes one BLOOD
  MARKER on the shooter. A model cannot make a ranged attack with the punt gun unless it is either STRONG or
  another friendly model is in base contact with it.
  Anti-tank Hammer
  A polearm with a directional explosive mounted on its head. It is exceedingly good at taking out armoured targets but puts
  its user in grave danger.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Anti-Tank Hammer 2-handed Melee +1D to Injuries RISKY, CRITICAL

  models within 8” of the Prophet (including the Prophet) that are not engaged in
  melee can immediately move up to 3” towards any enemy model they can see by

  0-1 Shrine Anchorite (Cost: 140 Ducats)
  A colossal suit of machine armour fuelled by diesel and faith, the Shrine Anchorite stands
  as a grim symbol of humanity’s despair. Within its spiked, blood-stained interior, the pilotmonk endures a terrible form of penance, his anguished prayers and chants echoing across
  the battlefield. This grotesque amalgamation of suffering and devotion instils fear in the
  heart of the heretic, as the anchorite, a malevolent weapon draped in holy iconography and
  weeping gore, emerges to unleash a symphony of slaughter, where the wretched union of
  man and machine heralds the demise of all who oppose the Almighty.
  Name Movement Ranged Melee Armour Base
  Anchorite 6”/Infantry N/A +2 Dice -3 60mm
  Equipment
  You cannot buy additional equipment, weapons or armour for Shrine Anchorites. Each
  Anchorite is equipped with a special suit of armour (reflected in the profile), a Combat
  Helmet, a Catherine Wheel and a Bonebreaker Mace. These pieces of equipment are
  built into the integrity of its construction and cannot be removed or lost in any way.
  The weapons are detailed below. The Anchorite may make one attack ACTION with
  each of these weapons in Melee Combat and may make no other attacks during its
  Activation (so it can make two attacks per Activation).
  ; Catherine Wheel: The Anchorite treats the Catherine Wheel as a one-handed
  melee weapon with the Keywords RISKY and HEAVY that grants a +1 DICE
  bonus to hit (for a total of +3 DICE due to its Melee Characteristic). Because of
  the enormous weight and the skill of the Anchorite Shrine in inflicting maximum
  pain, the Catherine Wheel rolls on the Injury Chart with 3D6 (instead of usual
  2D6), adding all three dice together!
  ; Bonebreaker Mace: The Anchorite treats the Bonebreaker Mace as a onehanded melee weapon with the Keyword RISKY. The Bonebreaker Mace has a
  +1 DICE bonus to injure. Because the Mace is wielded alongside the Catherine
  Wheel, it is treated as an Off-Hand Weapon and suffers penalties accordingly.
  Abilities
  ; Tough: The Shrine Anchorite is a huge, hulking mound of metal and is subject
  to the rules for TOUGH creatures.
  ; Fear: The Anchorite causes FEAR.
  ; Broken on the Wheel: Before the start of the battle, one Trench Pilgrim or
  Ecclesiastic Prisoner may voluntarily be broken on the wheel to show their piety
  and devotion (permanently remove all weapons, armour and equipment from the
  victim and use/store them as you wish). The Anchorite will then shatter the bones
  of the volunteer and carry the broken victim to the battle on its Wheel. As long
  as the volunteer is not taken Out of Action, any Attacks against the Anchorite
  are redirected to the volunteer. The volunteer cannot be independently targeted
  by any abilities or attacks (including BLAST weapons). For all rules purposes and
  attack effects (such as forced movement), the two models are treated as a single
  model, including sharing BLOOD, INFECTION and BLESSING MARKERS. Treat
  Down results against the volunteer as a Minor Hit. The volunteer cannot take any
  ACTIONS, be Activated separately or move – for obvious reasons. At the end of
  the battle, even if the volunteer may have survived, the model dies and is removed
  from your warband.

  Affliction
  Trench Pilgrims of the Procession of the Sacred

  adorned with the depictions of the Saints, which despite
  appearances can withstand machine gun bullets. The
  millstones they carry upon their backs are used to tie

  Warband Variant:
  Cavalcade of the Tenth
  Plague
  This Trench Pilgrim Procession traditionally sacrifices
  lambs before battle, anointing themselves in its blood
  to ward off the wrath of God. The Pilgrims then draw
  holy symbols with the blood of the sacrifice upon their
  bodies, clothing and armour, and then march to battle
  singing hymns, in certain belief that the blood of the
  Lamb shields them from any harm.
  Firm believers in traditional reading of the Holy Texts,
  they reject the new doctrines of the Meta-Christ by
  the Church. They steal Communicants from other
  Processions and force them to fight for them in penance
  for being born from Sin.
  Special Rules
  ; Blood Sacrifice: Any model (except Ecclesiastic
  Prisoners who are not worthy) in the warband can
  purchase a Sacrificial Lamb (see below).
  ; Heaven Awaits: The Cavalcade rejects the
  doctrine of the Meta-Christ. Their dead Pilgrims
  cannot be resurrected as Martyr-Penitents.
  ; The Unclean: The Cavalcade detests using the
  unclean Ecclesiastic Prisoners and may have only up
  to two of them.
  ; Day of his Wrath: The War Prophet of this
  warband cannot use Laying on Hands but can call
  upon the Wrath of God instead. This is a RISKY
  ACTION. If successful, roll on the Injury Chart
  against one enemy model within 3” of the Prophet.
  Armour offers no protection against this attack.
  ; Stolen Communicants: Communicants cost
  3 Glory Points instead of ducats for this warband
  due to the difficulty of acquiring and indoctrinating
  them.
  ; Favour of the Lord: At the start of each turn,
  you can give any one model in the warband a
  BLESSING MARKER.

  Warband Variant: War
  Pilgrimage of
  Saint Methodius
  From the Night of Fire and Blood that laid low the
  Greater Moravian monastery of Velehrad emerged a
  single monk of the Orthodox Order of St. Methodius.
  Though the rest of the brotherhood perished in the
  catastrophe, slaughtered by a squadron of ruthless Death
  Commandos, the sole survivor brought with him the
  books of the Saint and his faith out of the ruin.
  With the loss of the workshops and monastic libraries
  of Velehrad, it was believed that the secrets of the
  Anchorite construction were lost, especially since the
  Church no longer wished to pursue their construction
  due to advances in armour technology elsewhere. But
  this was in error. The monk, named brother Akakios,
  still knew the craft.
  Akakios fled to the Theocratia of Hellas and founded
  a new monastery on the slopes of holy Mount Athos.
  Many monks lived in the monastic communities on
  the slopes of the mountain and some were attracted to
  join their brother. Thus Akakios became the first War
  Prophet of the Order and many lay members joined or
  became supporters and, eventually, the foot soldiers of
  the well-equipped and disciplined War Pilgrimages of
  St. Methodius. No other Pilgrim Progression can match
  the methodical and technical approach of the soldiers of
  the Order.
  In their fortified monastery the learned monks hoard
  and protect the knowledge of modifying the sacred
  designs of St. Methodius. Their Shrine Anchorites are
  without a peer and feature many modern weapons and
  adjustments which allow them to carry modern longrange weaponry. No other warband has such abundant
  access to Anchorites or the variety of sophisticated
  weaponry and equipment.
  Following the ancient Orthodox creed, the pilgrims
  of St. Methodius reject many of the teachings and
  customs of other Pilgrim Processions. They consider the
  creation of the Communicants as a dangerous heresy and
  condemn the use of Martyrdom Devices as an affront to
  God’s commandment against suicide, as well as holding
  to other beliefs many of the Trench Pilgrims view as
  an essential part of their crusade against the forces of
  Inferno. Bitter schisms and arguments with other sects
  sometimes erupt into violence, and the Church itself
  accuses the Order of Hetrodoxy of clinging to the
  outdated Eastern Orthodox faith.
  However, due to their formidable fortress monasteries
  upon Mount Athos and their undeniable zeal on the
  battlefield, the Princes of the Church turn a blind eye to
  the affairs of the followers of St. Methodius, as long as
  they focus all their zeal in the seemingly impossible task
  of relieving the city of Trebizond. Here, according to
  the visions of prophet Akakios, the unsullied faith is still
  practiced and the Salvation of Mankind will be achieved.
  To this end, the Order sends one War Pilgrimage after
  another to the front line. Not one has made it within
  sight of the fabled walls of Trebizond, but this only
  increases the zeal of the Order and rouses them into ever
  greater efforts to reach the City of the Hill.
  Special Rules
  ; Anchorite Cloister: This warband may buy up to
  two Anchorite Shrines.
  ; Anchorite Armoury: This warband may alter
  the weaponry and equipment of their Anchorites as
  indicated below. Anchorites of St. Methodius have
  +0 DICE to their Ranged Characteristic.
  ; Mortal Sin: No Ecclesiastic Prisoner of the
  warband may be equipped with a Martyrdom
  Device and no member of the warband can be
  Broken on the Wheel.
  ; Communicant Heresy: The Pilgrims of St.
  Methodius oppose the creation of Communicants
  and therefore cannot include them in their
  warbands. This includes Mercenaries.
  ; Treasure in Heaven: The Trench Pilgrims of
  this warband cannot be resurrected as MartyrPenintents.
  ; Chaste Order: While they revere the holy
  stigmata of the nuns of the order, the fathers of the
  monasteries shun the ecstatic revelry of many Trench
  Pilgrims and insist on modest dress. All Stigmatic
  Nuns of the warband must wear Standard Armour.
  In addition, the warband may only have a maximum
  of three Stigmatic Nuns.
  ; Gunsmith Monks: The warband can buy
  Machine Guns (LIMIT: 2) at a cost of 50 ducats
  each, an Automatic Rifle (LIMIT: 1) for 40 ducats
  and a Submachine Gun (LIMIT: 1) for 30 ducats.

  Due to its construction and immense size, any Anchorite
  of this warband may use any one of these weapons as a

  Rules: Specify a point on the battlefield within 36” (must be in line of sight) that you want to target. Next, take a
  Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location,
  multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot lands 2”
  away, as 7 – 5 = 2). The direction is decided by your opponent. All models within 3” of the 1 x 1 mm landing spot

  The Iron Sultanate
  hen the Infidels opened the thrice-
  cursed Gate to Jahannam, releasing
  Gog and Magog upon those who
  believe, it seemed that all was lost and
  Shaytan would emerge victorious over
  Dunya. But the Creator of the Universe came to the aid
  of the Faithful, and as had been written, the great Iron
  Wall of Dhu al-Qarnayn manifested itself in the lands
  ruled by the Sultan of Rûm. A call was sent to those
  who believe righteously and, over the coming decades,
  the migration of the Faithful took place across Europa,
  Asia and Africa. Millions perished on the road and at
  sea, for the Heretics and their Shaytan lords swarmed
  them as locusts swarm fields of ripe sesame, devouring
  them and building vile monuments from their limbs
  and heads, so they could not be buried as is decreed
  in the Holy texts. But once all those who survived the
  journey had come, the mighty Gates of al-Qarnayn
  were closed and the Great Sultanate of the Invincible
  Iron Wall of the Two Horns That Pierce the Sky was
  formed.
  The assaults of the slaves of Jahannam against the
  Sultanate have never ceased since that day, and each day
  new martyrs are mourned as they defend the Wall and
  confront the heretics who have overcome its defences.
  But within the walls, the lost knowledge flourishes and
  from mosques of white marble and gold the muezzin
  call the faithful to pray for the success of the Sultan’s
  army as it struggles to protect their lands and defend
  the caravan trails that provide the Sultanate with vital
  trade goods.
  The Iron Wall is the greatest defensive work in the
  world, a mighty bulwark festooned with the famed
  artillery of the Sultan. Azeb sharpshooters stand at
  ready, ever watchful for surprise attacks, and the elite
  Janissary regiments have barracks at set intervals near
  the wall so they can react to any attack at speed. During
  a more serious incursion a full muster of Azebs is
  called, the House of Wisdom unleashes its terrifying
  takwin creations upon the foe, and if the need is
  desperate, the Sultan himself comes forth and his
  In the name of Allah, the
  Compassionating, the
  Compassionate! Praise be to
  Allah, The Beneficent King, The
  Creator of the Universe, Lord
  of the Three Worlds, Who set up
  The Firmament without Pillars
  in its Stead and Who stretched
  out the Earth even as a Bed; and
  Grace, and Prayer-Blessing be
  upon Our Lord Mohammed, Lord
  of Apostolic Men, and upon His
  Family and Companion-Train;
  Prayer and Blessings Enduring
  and Grace Which unto The Day of
  Doom shall Remain!
- Scheherazade
  Glory to the Great Sultan, the
  Padishah of Rûm, the Dispenser
  of Crowns to the Monarchs on the
  face of the Earth, and the Shadow
  of God on Earth, Custodian of the
  Invincible Iron Wall of the Two
  Horns that pierce the Sky which
  protects us from the ravages of Gog
  and Magog!
  Janissaries march with him to do battle, carrying their
  green flag before them.
  Thus the protection of the Iron Wall has had an
  extensive influence on the Sultanate Way of war. The
  conscripted Azebs are experts at feigned flight and
  skirmish, while the loping Lions of Jabir harass the
  enemy’s flanks. All the while the superb artillery of
  the Sultan bombards the enemy as they make their
  tortuous journey across the battlefield littered with
  traps set by skilled Sappers. When they reach the
  ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite
  household troops, close in and finish the enemy with
  their devastating counter-charge led by their ironwilled officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl
  in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and
  leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom
  unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their
  elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences
  of virtually any foe.
  Beyond the Iron Wall forces of the Sultan operate
  in small, mobile companies, each with a particular
  mission to accomplish. They hunt down apostates
  that have gone to serve Shaytans, look for the relics
  from the time of the Prophets, or seek to recover lost
  treasures and books of knowledge from the ruins
  of the fallen Caliphates. Though an understanding
  between the Church and the Sultanate on being cobelligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders
  of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and
  do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder
  their mission. Resentment against the infidels who
  unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate,
  and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to
  the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission
  of Those Who Believe.

  Sultanate Special Weapons, Armour & Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Iron Sultanate warband.
  Jezzail
  These long arms are by far the most common weapons carried by the soldiers of the Sultanate of the Great Iron Wall. Their
  barrels are smoothbore which limits their accuracy at range, but this is more than made up for by the fact that this allows
  them to be loaded with different types of alchemical ammunition made by the Jabirean Alchemists.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Jezzail 2-handed 18” - -
  MURAD Bombard
  Named after the great Sultan who commissioned the first of these weapons to defend the Iron Wall, this mighty bombard is
  used to disrupt advancing enemy formations. The echo of its blast recites the 99 names of Allah, throwing even the greatest
  of warriors to ground like chaff.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  MURAD Bombard 1-handed 36” - HEAVY,
  BLAST 3”
  Rules: Specify a point on the battlefield within 36” (must be in line of sight) that you want to target. Next, take a
  Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended location,
  multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot lands 2”
  away, as 7-5=2). The direction is decided by your opponent. All models within 3” of the landing 1x1mm landing spot
  are hit as the bomb explodes – no roll to hit is needed. If the bomb lands directly on top of any model, roll with 3D6
  on the Injury Chart and add the dice together to see what happens! Other models hit by the bombard suffer a Down
  result due the booming shockwave, but do not incur any BLOOD MARKERS or other effects from this attack.
  Flame Cannon
  A great cannon that shoots a stream of alchemical fire with tremendous force. It has a tendency to overheat and ignite the
  skin of its artillery crew, but the mighty Brazen Bulls use them as mere handguns. The secret formula used for the fuel of
  the Flame Cannons was gleaned from the lost Byzantine ruins, and is commonly known as Greek Fire.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Flame Cannon 1-handed 12” - HEAVY, FIRE
  Rules: When shot in ranged combat, draw a straight 12” line that is 1mm wide from the Brazen Bull. All models
  along the path of the line are automatically hit – roll for their injuries immediately. Armour does not protect against
  the Flame Cannon. Due to the Keyword FIRE, its hits cause an additional +1 BLOOD MARKER. This is applied after
  rolling for injuries.
  Titan Zulfiqar
  This twin-tongued greatsword can weigh up to 300 pounds – only the mighty Brazen Bulls can even lift this monstrous
  blade, let alone wield it in combat. It sheer weight and mono-molecule sharpness cuts through even the thickest armour
  when swung by the superhuman strength of the takwin monstrosity.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Zulfiqar 1-handed Melee +2 to injury rolls HEAVY,
  CRITICAL
  Rules: Add +2 to the result of all injuries caused by this weapon (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 9).

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Assassin’s Dagger
  The blades of the Assassins are imbued with the Supreme Poison. In chambers deep below the surface, generations of young
  assassins are raised in the dark; fed a diet of scorpions, frogs, deadly mushrooms and even stranger, more noxious things,
  and generation by generation their tolerance grows. The poisonous blood of these willing vessels is drawn and smelted into
  a poisonous iron. The iron is forged into blades and deadly spells of slaying layered into each fold of the envenomed metal.
  Thus the blood of the first generation of Assassins lives to this day, growing more potent with each generation.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Assassin’s Dagger 1-handed Melee +1 to Injury CRITICAL
  Rules: Adds +1 to injury rolls (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 8). If the Assassin hits an enemy and causes
  at least one BLOOD MARKER, the Assassin can move away from combat during this Activation. Note that this move
  does not grant enemies free attacks. Assassins can use both normal and Dash move to do this, though this may not be
  used for charging.
  Halberd-Gun
  Invention of the House of Wisdom, this weapon acts both as a symbol of high rank and an excellent weapon in combat.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Halberd-Gun 2-handed Melee/24” - ASSAULT,
  CUMBERSOME
  Rules: Enemies charging a model equipped with a Halberd-gun add -1 DICE in melee combat when rolling to hit.
  This only applies when a model attacks after a charge, not on subsequent rounds of melee.
  Siege Jezzail
  Heavier version of the standard Jezzail. It is a large, cumbersome weapon with a shot of lead or iron weighing as much as
  four pounds, designed to take out even the most powerful enemies with a single shot. Azebs armed with these weapons use
  tripod stakes when firing them, but the mighty Janissaries often use them as their standard service gun.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Siege Jezzail 2-handed 30” +1D to Injuries HEAVY
  Rules: Roll all injuries with +1 DICE.
  Alaybozan
  The design of this blunderbuss is based on the traditional design of tribal warriors but thoroughly modernised by the
  foundries of the Sultanate. It has proven its worth as the preferred weapon of the Sapper corps who must often fight in
  close quarters. It shoots a hail of lead bullets and iron shrapnel.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Alaybozan 2-handed 12” - SHRAPNEL
  Alchemist Armour
  Suit of armour which protects against almost all harm. This is an essential tool of Alchemists’ craft, festooned with the
  Seals of Solomon which enables them to bend the elements of Creation to their will and shields them even from the
  devices of Hell.
  Rules: Counts as Reinforced Armour and therefore grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls made against the model
  wearing it. All attacks with the Keyword FIRE and/or GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure this model.
  Additionally, this model does not suffer additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keywords FIRE and/or GAS.

  Alchemical Ammunition
  Jabirean Alchemists craft these Jezzail bullets from the slivers of the Iron Wall. Each such shot is carved the Seal of
  Solomon, guiding them during their path through the air.
  Rules: Adds +1 DICE to Ranged Attack rolls on the Action Success Chart. Can only be used with Jezzails,
  Alaybozan, Halberd-Guns and Siege Jezzails.
  Cloak of Alamut
  Created by the secret arts of the Assassin’s sect aeons ago, this cloak bends the light so that its wearer looks almost
  indistinguishable against any surface when they are still. It is this masterwork of Alamut that has led to the tales of the
  fabled Cloak of Invisibility in the legends of the Sultanate.
  Rules: All ranged attacks against a model that is in cover suffer -2 DICE penalty instead of -1 DICE. All the
  normal rules for cover apply otherwise.
  Wind Amulet
  Amulet created by the Jabirean Alchemists, capturing the essence of the Element of Wind within it.
  Rules: Once per battle, you may add +3” to the Movement characteristic of this model once during the activation.
  Declare this when the model is Activated.
  Marid Shovel
  You can buy this enormous shovel made from alchemical bronze which makes it almost indestructible. Brazen bulls use it
  for public works (such as digging canals, foundations of buildings and mining) during peacetime, while at war it is used
  for digging trenches, ditches and bunkers.
  Rules: The Marid Shovel has the Keyword HEAVY which allows a Brazen Bull to use it. Otherwise it works exactly
  like a normal shovel.

  The Brazen Bull is a monstrous being of immense power and vitality, capable of tearing
  even the bastard child of a devil clean in half. The Sultan’s armourers equip the Bulls with
  heavy artillery that even the superhuman Janissaries cannot lift, let alone use in battle:
  flame cannons, volley guns and holy blades blessed by the Word of the Great Protector.

  Brazen Bull 6”/Infantry +0 Dice +2 Dice 0 60mm
  Equipment
  A Brazen Bull can be equipped with any weapon, armour and equipment from the Iron
  Sultanate Armoury. Due to its vast strength and size it can only use weapons with the
  Keyword HEAVY – it will simply crush weapons of normal size by accident. It can carry
  up to two Brazen Bull Only weapons.
  Abilities
  ; Tough: Brazen Bulls are almost impervious to pain. They are subject to the

  Warband Variant: Fida’i
  of Alamut – The Cabal of
  Assassins
  The pact between the Iron Sultanate and the Assassin
  fortress of Alamut ensures that the Sultan is served by
  the exquisitely skilled killers of the Old Man of the
  Mountain in exchange for independence of the Assassin’s
  domain.
  But though most outsiders know the Assassins through
  their service to the forces of the Iron Wall, sometimes
  during the dark of night small, deadly bands move
  silently into the hellscape of No Man’s Land. In deepest
  secrecy Rashid al-Din Sinan, the undisputed ruler of
  Alamut dispatches his hand-picked disciples on Missions
  of his own, communicating their orders with no spoken
  words, signs nor written messages, but talking directly
  to them in their dreams. What the purpose of such
  operations is no-one knows, and not even the most
  sadistic Heretic torturer-priest has been able to make
  them divulge the secrets of Alamut from captured
  Assassins. These warbands are known as Fida’i (which
  means ‘Sacrifice’), dedicated to completing their mission
  and returning to Alamut to receive rewards said to be
  able to match those of Paradise itself. They are led by a
  Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of Alamut,
  with two fully-trained members of the Order. A number
  of trainee acolytes will serve them during the mission,
  eager to prove their mettle and be initiated into the
  Order of Assassins.
  Alamut is also a home to a renegade sect of Ismaili
  Dervishes, warrior monks sworn to poverty and a lethal
  way of fighting. They accompany the Assassins on their
  secret missions as an act of piety and payment for their
  shelter, and their whirling dance of death has been the
  end of many a disbeliever.
  Fida’i of Alamut Rules
  The Fida’i of Alamut Warband has the following special
  rules:
  ; Flock of Assassins: The Fida’i of Alamut can
  have up to three Assassins. The warband must
  include a Master Assassin that counts as one of the
  three (see below).
  ; Master Assassin: A Master Assassin has the
  Keyword TOUGH. The Master Assassin costs 95
  ducats.
  ; Assassin Acolytes: Up to three Azebs of the
  warband can have the Keyword INFILTRATOR at
  the cost of +10 ducats per model.
  ; Alamut Alone: The warband may not include
  Yüzbaşı, Alchemist, Janissaries, Lions of Jabir or
  Brazen Bulls.
  ; Killing Squad: Your warband may have a single
  Fireteam. These Fireteams may consist of any two
  models from your warband. Models in Fireteams
  gain the Keyword FIRETEAM.
  ; Dervishes: The warband may include up to
  four Dervishes (use Janissary statistics including
  Armoury selection, but they cannot use Reinforced
  Armour). These troops have the Whirling Dervishes
  special rule instead of the Keyword STRONG:
  ; Whirling Dervishes: The ritual Dance of
  the Dervishes is hypnotic to witness, and it is
  as graceful as it is deadly. All Ranged attacks
  against Dervishes suffer -1 DICE penalty.
  Dervishes do not suffer the normal -1 DICE to
  hit for fighting with an Off-Hand weapon.
  Art of Assassination
  Any Assassin of the warband may buy any one of these
  abilities at the cost indicated below. There cannot be any
  duplicates in the warband and you can only buy one for
  each Assassin.
  Hallucinogen Disguise 20 ducats
  An INFILTRATOR with this ability can be deployed
  anywhere on the battlefield, including the enemy
  Deployment Zone, as long as the model is at least 8”
  away from any enemy models. The model does not have
  to be out of Line of Sight. Binoculars or Guard Dogs
  have no effect on this ability.
  Thunderbolt of Alamut 20 ducats
  The model has +2” movement and +1 DICE on its
  Dash ACTIONS.
  Mirage of Time 15 ducats
  Both Ranged and Melee attacks against the Assassin
  suffer -1 DICE penalty when determining if they hit.
  Secret Paths 10 ducats
  At the start of the battle, right before the first model is
  set up, declare whether or not this model will be set up
  by using Secret Paths. A model using the Secret Paths is
  not set up on the battlefield at the start of the battle and
  it may not be activated normally during the first turn.
  Starting in the second turn, you may activate these
  models. When you do, set up the model in contact with
  an edge of the battlefield but more than 8” away from
  all enemy models at the start of its activation. If both
  players have such models, the starting player declares
  whether one of their models is deployed or not first,
  followed by the other player. Alternate as normal until
  all such models have been declared as using Secret Paths
  or not.

  Fida’i of Alamut Special Weapons and Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Fida’i of Alamut Warband.
  Golden Khanjar 20 ducats
  Placed on a hand of an especially favoured killer by the Old Man of the Mountain himself, these wickedly curved daggers
  gleam as if they were made of gold, but instead they are crystallised poison, and allow their wielder to attack twice in the
  same instance of time. Only the Master of Alamut himself knows the secret of making these blades.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Golden Khanjar 1-handed Melee +1 Injury, 2 Attacks
  Rules: Adds +1 to injury rolls (i.e. a roll of 7 on the Injury Chart becomes 8). A model armed with a Golden Khanjar
  can make two attacks instead of one in melee with one Melee Attack ACTION. This effect also applies to a Golden
  Khanjar wielded off-hand.
  Assassin Only, LIMIT: 2
  Bow of Alamut 50 ducats
  This terrifying double-stringed bow shoots its deadly barbs through both time and space. Its arrows can reach impossible
  distances and pass through armour by flickering through time. It leaves behind a temporal slipstream that the Assassin can
  travel through in an eyeblink.
  Made from wood taken from trees planted in the skulls of ancient assassins in the Garden of Alamut so that they might
  absorb mystic powers of their former owners, these bows are some of the greatest treasures of the Old Man of the Mountain
  for it is said that only six now remain in his secret armouries.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Bow of Alamut 2-handed 40” Ignores Armour CRITICAL
  Rules: Ignores Armour. If the Assassin hits a model and causes at least one BLOOD MARKER, the Assassin may
  instantly place itself into Melee Combat with that model if there is a legal space that the Assassin could occupy
  within 1” of that model, regardless of the distance to the target or any interposing models/obstacles. The Assassin is
  considered to have charged that model, although it does not count as a Charge ACTION and therefore the Assassin
  can take the Move ACTION at a later point on this turn, if it hasn’t already. Note that if the bow takes the target Out
  of Action, no BLOOD MARKERS are caused and this movement cannot be made.
  Assassin Only, LIMIT: 1
  Hashashin Leaf 5 ducats
  These leaves from the secret Garden of Alamut enhance the strength of anyone who eats them threefold. Once the effect
  wears off the subject will suffer from agonising muscle tears and ripping of ligaments, but many of the Order of Assassins
  feel that this is a small price to pay for being able to use deadlier weapons.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to gain the Keyword STRONG until the end of a battle.

  The House of Wisdom
  “Read in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who
  Created man, out of a clot of congealed blood: Proclaim!
  And thy Lord is Most Bountiful, He Who taught the pen,
  Taught man that which he knew not.”
  -Surah 96
  The House of Wisdom is the pre-eminent centre
  of learning within the Iron Sultanate. Its libraries,
  workshops, forges, gardens of exotic and wondrous
  plants, hospitals and observatories are unmatched.
  Within its halls are mechanical marvels and weapons
  from far-off lands, as well as trophies captured by the
  Sultan’s forces and brought to be examined by the
  learned scholars of the House of Wisdom. Philosophers
  and theologists debate in its chambers; ghanzal and
  qasīda poets compose verses describing the beauty and
  pain of life. Thus it is no wonder that the House attracts
  the greatest minds of the age to study in its hallowed
  halls, from within the Sultanate and far beyond the Iron
  Wall.
  In its laboratories guarded by the faithful Kavass, the
  Jabirean Alchemists dissect and study the War Beasts
  of Shaitan so their weaknesses can be laid bare and
  exploited by the Believers. At such times, their roars of
  rage and pain echo through the porphyry corridors of
  the House.
  To maintain a degree of independence, regardless of the
  royal funding, the House of Wisdom performs many
  services for the Sultan’s armies. Their best alchemists
  work with the Sultanate foundries where the Great
  Cannons of the Iron Wall are cast. Takwin creations are
  provided to bolster the army of Those Who Believe, as
  are suits of armour and alchemical ammunition. The
  House of Wisdom also maintains the Sultanate fleet of
  airships, which both guard the realms of Those Who
  Believe against enemy air forces and maintain vigil over
  lands under darkness. They make regular excursions
  deep into enemy territory to witness whether the Great
  Sandstorm still covers the Two Holy Places, reporting
  any news back to the Sultan.
  In exchange, the masters of the House of Wisdom
  have freedom to despatch their own excursions and
  expeditions into the lands beyond the wall, to seek tomes
  of knowledge lost in the dark and terrible days when
  the forces of Jahannam overran much of the Levant
  and great cities fell like blossoms of a Jasmine flower in
  fiery heat. Sometimes they are journeys to capture an
  especially ferocious beast of the enemy. At other times
  they seek to capture or kill Heretic Alchemists which
  they see as both an offence to their craft and a threat to
  the entire world.
  These journeys are exceedingly dangerous and they are
  not undertaken lightly. Each Alchemist dispatched on
  such a journey is an irreplaceable loss, and since they
  operate under their own authority, they cannot expect
  direct support from the Sultan’s forces. Many noble Fāris
  warriors have taken oaths to protect these scholars in
  their journeys, as well as their own Kavass bodyguards
  sworn to fight and die in defence of their Masters.
  House of Wisdom Rules
  The House of Wisdom warband has the following
  special rules:
  ; Alchemists: The House of Wisdom warband
  may have up to two Alchemists and must include at
  least one. This warband treats Alchemist Armour as
  if they had a LIMIT of 2.
  ; Pride of Jabir: The warband may include up to
  three Lions of Jabir.
  ; Private Venture: The warband may not include
  any Azebs, Janissaries, Yüzbaşi or Assassins.
  ; Noble Guardians: The warband may include up
  to two Fāris – noble warriors sworn to protect the
  House of Wisdom. They use the Janissary stats but
  have the Keywords ELITE and STRONG.
  ; Kavass: Kavass are sworn guardians of the House
  of Wisdom. They use Azebs stats but cannot buy the
  Keyword SKIRMISHER. Instead, up to three Kavass
  can increase their Melee Characteristic by +1 DICE
  (to +0D) at the cost of +5 ducats per model.
  ; Weapon Collections: When you create this
  warband, choose two weapons. These weapons must
  be found in either the Armouries of New Antioch
  or the Trench Pilgrims. These weapons must not
  already be present in the Iron Sultanate Armoury.
  Your warband may acquire one from New Antioch
  and one from the Trench Pilgrim armoury, following
  all of the same limitations and costs of the original
  lists. Only one weapon can be picked from this list.
  If lost in battle, it can be repurchased by paying the
  indicated cost.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Secrets of the House of Wisdom
  Any Alchemist of the warband may buy any one of these Abilities at the cost indicated below. You cannot have
  duplicates of these abilities in the Warband, as the House of Wisdom does not want to risk depleting the number of
  their scholars in a single discipline.
  Medicine 15 ducats
  This Alchemist is a student of Ibn Sina’s School of Medicine. The model is equipped with tools for healing from the
  House of Wisdom. The Alchemist can take an ACTION with +1 DICE to remove up to two BLOOD MARKERS
  or a single INFECTION MARKER from any one friendly model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow
  one friendly model (including themselves) who is Down to regain their footing. This training and these tools are an
  improvement upon the standard Medi-Kit and therefore a model with this Secret cannot carry a Medi-Kit.
  Cartography & Geometry 20 ducats
  The Alchemist has studied long and hard the sciences of cartography and geometry. At the beginning of each battle,
  immediately before any models are deployed, up to two models in your warband gain the Keyword INFILTRATOR,
  This ability cannot affect an Alchemist or a model with a base larger than 32mm. In addition, the warband may reroll one Exploration dice in the Exploration phase if you wish. The second result stands.
  Secrets of Takwin 20 ducats
  The Alchemist has bound their Takwin creature to themselves with unbreakable bonds. If the Alchemist is hit by
  an attack while within 1” of their Homunculus, you may redirect the hit to the Homunculi instead. Determine the
  injuries and additional effects exactly as if the weapon just hit the Homunculi.
  Chemistry & Alchemy 25 ducats
  Before the battle starts, but after all models (including INFILTRATORS) are deployed, you may place a rectangular
  elemental obstacle 2” wide and 6” long. It counts both as Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain, and damage it
  causes has the Keyword FIRE, GAS or SHRAPNEL (chosen when the obstacle is placed). It cannot be placed within
  6” of any model or on top of any other Terrain.
  Philosophy, Poetry and Theology 20 ducats
  The Alchemist is well-versed in the hidden truths of the universe and of the Divine, and has a calm and clear mind.
  The warband gains +1 DICE to all Morale Rolls, cannot become Shaken and the Alchemist plus another model of
  your choice is immune to the effects of the Keyword FEAR.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Takwin Creatures
  You can bring one Takwin creature for each Alchemist in your warband. Each Takwin creature must be associated
  with an Alchemist in your warband. If a Takwin creature’s associated Alchemist is killed (typically by acquiring three
  scars), that Takwin creature cannot be fielded, its equipment cannot be changed and no Alchemical Formulae may
  be applied to it. When you acquire a new Alchemist, if you have any unallocated Takwin creatures, you must allocate
  that new Alchemist with one of your unallocated Takwin creatures. Instead of using Glory, you must buy them with
  ducats as indicated on the list below.

  ; Re-creation: If the Homunculus is taken Out of Action during battle, and is deemed to have been killed in
  the post-battle sequence, you do not have to remove it from your roster. Instead, you can spend 40 ducats at any
  time between battles to bring it back to life with all of its weapons and abilities.
  ; Artificial Body: Created through the Jabirean alchemy, the Homunculus has no vital organs and they have to
  be dismembered in order to kill them. All injury rolls against the Homunculus are made with -1 DICE.
  Keywords
  SULTANATE
  Alchemical formulae
  You may buy any of these Alchemical Formulae for your Homunculus, either during its creation or later during any
  Post-Battle Sequence, as long as you pay the price of each formula. Once bought they are permanent.
  You can never have more than one Alchemic Formula of the same type applied into a single Takwin creature unless
  otherwise specified.
  ; Wings (30 ducats): The Homunculus gains a new movement mode: 8”/Flying.
  ; Elemental Resistance (40 ducats): Attacks made against the Homunculus that have the Keywords FIRE
  and/or GAS suffer a -1 DICE penalty to injure it. Also the Homunculus does not suffer additional BLOOD
  MARKERS from attacks with Keywords FIRE and/or GAS.
  ; Massive size (30 ducats): The Homunculus’ size is increased to huge proportions. It now has a base size of
  50mm and it gains the Keyword TOUGH. This formula cannot be combined with the Wings formula.
  ; Enslaved Mind (10 ducats): The Homunculus gains the Keyword FIRETEAM along with one model of your
  choice in the Warband. The other model can only form a Fireteam with this Homunculi, not with any other
  models.
  ; Human hands (10 ducats): The Homunculus can buy and wield any weapon allowed in the Iron Sultanate
  warband or House of Wisdom list, though they cannot select ELITE only items, grenades or items limited
  to specific units (such as Assassins). They can also carry a Trench Shield or a Fire Shield. This will apply to the
  Additional Arms formula as well. Cannot be combined with the Wings formula.
  ; Inhuman Strength (15 ducats): The musculature of the Homunculus is reinforced, replaced and
  strengthened. It now has a base size of 32mm (or 50mm if it also has Massive size). The Homunculus gains +1
  DICE to its Melee characteristic and the Keyword STRONG.
  ; Terrifying Appearance (10 ducats): Whether by captivating beauty or a terrifying appearance, this
  Homunculus gains the Keyword FEAR.
  ; Additional Arm (15 ducats): The Homunculus can perform an additional attack ACTION in Melee or
  Ranged combat without any penalty. Therefore, if making attacks with three melee weapons, only a single
  64
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  weapon would need to be declared an Off-Hand weapon (suffering the appropriate penalties). It has three hands
  to carry weapons if combined with Human Hands, and may equip weapons and a shield in any combination, as
  long as it has hands free to do so. In this case the Homunculi can make up to two Ranged Attack ACTIONS (if it
  has sufficient weapons and number of hands to carry them), and up to three Melee Attack ACTIONS (if armed
  with three one-handed weapons); or one Melee Attack ACTION with a two-handed weapon and one Melee
  Attack ACTION with a one-handed weapon.
  ; Two heads (5 ducats): The Homunculus has two heads and therefore can have two sets of eyes via Alchemical
  Formula.
  ; Hypnotic Eyes (15 ducats): Enemies suffer -1 DICE to hit the Homunculus in Melee. Does not affect
  Sniper Priests or enemies with the keyword BLACK GRAIL. Cannot be combined with Hawk Eyes without Two
  Heads.
  ; Hawk Eyes (10 ducats): The eyesight of the Homunculus is based on that of a predatory bird. It can add +1
  DICE to its Ranged Attack characteristic. Cannot be combined with Hypnotic Eyes without Two Heads.
  ; Startling Speed (10 ducats): The Homunculus adds +1 DICE to its Dash ACTIONS.
  ; Seal of Solomon (10 ducats): This Formula greatly enhances the intelligence of the Homunculus and makes
  it painfully aware of its artificial existence. It can now buy and use Equipment from the Sultanate Warband
  Armoury as long as it is not limited to ELITE models. Note that one helmet protects a Homunculus with two
  heads normally and the Two Heads Formula does not allow the purchase of two different kinds of headgear.
  ; Gargantuan Size (20 ducats): Can only be bought if the Homunculus already has the Human Hands,
  Inhuman Strength and Massive Size Formulas. The Homunculus now has a Base Size of 60mm and it can now
  use one Brazen Bull Only weapon.
  ; Regenerative Tissue (25 ducats): The Homunculus has an astonishing healing factor and can remove one
  BLOOD MARKER every time it is Activated, if it has any.
  House of Wisdom Special Armoury
  The following items are exclusively available to the House of Wisdom warband.
  Elixir of Al-Khidr 10 ducats
  An extraordinary creation of the House of Wisdom. It is said that within its Gardens is the hidden Fountain of Life that is
  used as an ingredient of this powerful Alchemical formula.
  Rules: Gives the model consuming the Elixir Keyword TOUGH for the duration of a single battle. It cannot be given
  to Lions of Jabir, Brazen Bulls or Homunculi.
  CONSUMABLE, LIMIT: 1
  Fire Shield 20 ducats
  An Invention of the al-Jazari school of engineering within the House of Wisdom, this shield is treated with an Alchemical

  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat. Grants -1 to all injury rolls against the

  The Principality of New Antioch
  or three hundred years the Principality of
  New Antioch has stood defiantly as the focal
  point of the Church and the Faithful at the
  very edge of the shadow cast by the Gate
  of Hell. It is the Home of All Our Hopes,
  the bulwark against Heretic forces and the first line of
  defence against the devil’s might. Should New Antioch
  fall, the Levant will be lost and the path to heartlands of
  the Church will be wide open.
  War has never left this corner of the world. The ancient
  city of Antioch was destroyed by a mysterious demonic
  weapon in the year 1545, but the Faithful never gave up
  their positions in the ruins. Despite the lethal demonic
  essence emanating from the crater that was left behind,
  the garrison held on, even as mighty Constantinople fell
  to the legions of Kimaris, Marquis of Hell.
  Before it was destroyed, the ancient city of Antioch
  was always the first line of defence to be put to test.
  Thus it is no wonder that in the year 1559 the Sword
  Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify the
  city, and that a yearly tithe is to be sent to New Antioch
  by all the Faithful nations, though this levy is rarely in
  form of coin. Instead, endless supply trains of foodstuffs,
  tools, ammunition, weaponry, machinery and skilled
  workers and engineers come from across Europa and the
  Mediterranean Sea, as well as the African dominions.
  Since those days New Antioch has grown to be the
  most important fortress-city in the world, the Sword
  and the Shield of Europa and Africa. All the princes of
  the Church and heads of the various states and domains
  who oppose Hell understand that it is better to fight
  their battles against the Heretics as far away from their
  heartlands as possible. To this day New Antioch has
  withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with
  their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been
  breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites,
  metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within
  them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a
  vigilant watch over the walls day and night.
  More than anything else, it is the volunteers who
  come to serve under the Banner of Christ that ensure
  the continuous existence of the Principality. Thus in the
  streets of the city one can hear hundreds of languages
  and dialects. One might observe hussars of the PolishLithuanian commonwealth brushing shoulders with
  the last remnants of the Varangian Guard, or hear the
  sermons of a street preacher from Eire extolling the
  soldiery of Ethiopia to lay down their lives for the holy
  cause. Perhaps they might even witness the Church
  Engineers procession taking their latest invention to be
  tested in the front lines.
  As the nominal supreme commander of all the
  Faithful armed forces, the Duke of New Antioch is a title
  of unrivalled prestige and honour. But despite swearing
  fealty to the Duke, in reality most of the troops from
  across all of Christendom who come to do battle against
  Hell operate in units of their own, taking commands
  from their leaders and making their own strategic
  decisions.
  Still, some soldiers do indeed renounce their
  citizenship and take up the cross, and come to serve
  under Duke Constantine alone. Thus the standing army
  of the Principality is the greatest single fighting force the
  Faithful can muster, and those who serve on the walls of
  the Home of Hopes are rightfully proud of their livery.
  In recent years the Duke has despatched small forces
  into No Man’s Land to gather intelligence, look for
  artefacts of power, conduct raids on Heretic forces,
  secure strategic strongpoints and loot the battlefields
  for the wealth of coin and weaponry scattered across
  the tortured landscape that stretches between New
  Antioch and the Heretic domains over the centuries.
  These warbands are simply given commission by the
  Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster
  their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth
  and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there
  is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing
  to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot,
  supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these
  warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical
  forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench
  Pilgrims.
  F OATH OF NEW ANTIOCH
  “I swear to serve faithfully, loyally
  and honourably the reigning Duke
  and Duchess of New Antioch,
  and their legitimate successors, to
  devote myself to them with all my
  strength, sacrificing even my life in
  their defence.
  I assume the same duties towards
  the Princes of the Church and the
  city of New Antioch itself, for she
  is the Home of All Our Hopes. I
  shall make war against the Heretics
  without cessation and without
  mercy.
  I also promise my Commander
  and the other Superiors respect, fidelity and obedience. Thus I swear,
  may God and our Holy Patrons
  assist me.”

  New Antioch Fireteams
  Your warband may have up to two Fireteams. These

  between and can take their ACTIONS in any order
  they wish, switching between the two models.
  Note that if the Activation of either member of the
  FIRETEAM forcefully ends (due to a failed RISKY

  (ranged or melee) against an opponent, where the

  Elite: The officer corps
  1 Lieutenant (Cost: 70 Ducats)
  Your warband must include a Lieutenant when it is created.
  Lieutenants are leaders of small squads or platoons of New Antioch’s soldiers, playing a
  fundamental role on the distant frontlines of the Trench Crusade, displaying unwavering
  resolve in preserving the unity and morale of their troops. Lieutenants might be the
  favoured son or daughter of a noble family or gained their rank by impressing their
  superiors with their exceptional strategic acumen and audacious bravery.
  In addition to their command role, they are also responsible for acquiring new weapons,
  arms, equipment and food for their troops. All too often this requires looting the battlefields
  of No Man’s Land or even raiding settlements, since resupply can be sporadic at best.
  Having rightfully earned their position, Lieutenants enjoy the privilege of selecting their
  preferred arms and armour, often with the pick of the rarest battlefield finds. It is not
  uncommon for a Lieutenant to wield a distinctive weapon, perhaps a family heirloom, an
  idiosyncratic affectation or an ostentatious piece providing some much-needed swagger.

  Warband Variant: Papal
  States Intervention Force
  The Papal states who all operate under the command
  of the Supreme Pontiff of Rome rather than the Duke
  of New Antioch are sometimes dispatched to the front
  lines to perform a specific duty such as hunting down
  and eliminating dangerous Heretic leaders or recovering
  artefacts of great spiritual importance.
  These Warbands are typically quite small but have access
  to extremely elite soldiers and specialist equipment. They
  are led by utterly devoted warrior-monks and priests
  hand-picked by the Pope.
  Rules
  The Papal States Intervention Force has the following
  special rules:
  ; Specialist Force: A Papal States Intervention
  Force is recruited with 500 ducats and 11 Glory
  Points when creating a warband for a campaign.
  When recruiting a warband for a one-off battle, we
  recommend using 700 ducats and 15 Glory Points.
  ; Swiss Guard: Up to four non-ELITE troopers
  and the Lieutenant can be upgraded into Swiss
  Guards at the cost of 5 ducats each. They are
  immune to FEAR.
  ; Supreme Blessing: One model in the warband
  may carry the crucifix given by the Supreme Pontiff.
  This model can take further ACTIONS if it fails in an
  attempted RISKY ACTION. Note that the action
  fails, but you are allowed to try any other ACTIONS
  on your profile without losing the Activation. If the
  crucifix is lost, a new one can be acquired at the cost
  of 3 Glory Points.
  ; Far from home: The Papal Intervention Force
  may have no Trench Moles.
  ; Vatican’s representative: Papal States Warband
  must include a Trench Cleric but does not have to
  include a Lieutenant.
  ; Lector: Any Trench Cleric in the Papal
  Intervention Force can select the following prayer
  in addition to the ones usually available to a Trench
  Cleric:
  ; Arise and be Healed! Select one friendly
  model within 3” of the Priest and take
  a RISKY ACTION. If successful, the warrior
  immediately stands up if Down and loses
  up to D3 BLOOD MARKERS or INFECTION
  MARKERS (or any combination) of your
  choice.
  Warband Variant: Eire
  Rangers
  Eire is a stronghold of the Church and an ancient centre
  of learning. Due to the constant and devastating raids of
  the Heretic Navy, they are bitter enemies of the Infernal
  forces. The Emerald Isle has endured hunger and ravaged
  by the Black Grail, as well as a full-fledged invasion
  aimed at destroying the famed House of Manuscripts
  where many of the holiest of texts are kept. After this
  century of ruthless battles and brutal guerrilla warfare
  against the invaders, the warriors of Eire are now masters
  of skirmish fighting, hit-and-run tactics and ambushes.
  Elite Fianna warrior-hunters are especially adept at
  these guerrilla tactics: they uphold the ancient tradition
  of a band of roving warriors living off the land. While
  seen as trouble-makers and godless hellraisers, they
  are nevertheless expert skirmishers, and easily find
  employment in the warbands who take the Cross and
  travel to New Antioch to strike back at the enemy. These
  warriors adorn themselves with grisly trophies in the
  manner of their pagan ancestors, carrying skulls of the
  vanquished – much to the irritation of the Church.
  Due to the ravages of the wars, the island nation has few
  resources for heavy armour or most intricate automatic
  weapons, but they more than make up for this with their
  skilled light infantry and knowledge of the lay of the land.
  So when the Poet-King Tadhg O’Connor dispatches his
  famed Rangers to aid the Principality of New Antioch
  instead of paying the yearly tithe of Vienna, the Duke is
  more than happy to accept these fierce warriors instead.
  A rare latent Berserker trait runs in a few warrior
  bloodlines of Eire. It can be made to manifest with the
  Chemical Communion of the blood of the Meta-Christ.
  Such fighters enter a state of battle-rage, where no bullet
  or blade seems to cause them any harm.
  Rules
  The Eire Rangers has the following special rules:
  ; Fianna: Any Shocktroopers in an Eire Warband
  can be made a member of Fianna, the famed
  warrior-hunters. They cost +10 ducats each and have
  the Keywords SKIRMISHER and INFILTRATOR.
  ; Carnyx: Your army can purchase a special
  Carnyx instead of a generic musical instrument. This
  horn is identical to a musical instrument (including
  equipment restrictions and LIMIT), except it can be
  carried by an ELITE model and the model carrying
  it causes FEAR.
  ; Hit-and-run tactics: If a model of this warband
  uses the Retreat ACTION to move away from
  Combat, enemies have a -1 DICE penalty to hit
  rolls with their free attack.

  or Machine Armour. This does not apply to Combat
  Engineers’ Satchel Charges.
  ; Followers of St. Patrick: If playing a Campaign,

  ; Away, Serpents! Select any enemy within 12”
  of the Priest and take a RISKY ACTION (targeting

  Warband Variant:
  Stoßtruppen of the Free
  State of Prussia
  When the need to take out an enemy strongpoint or
  assault an especially powerful defensive line of trenches
  or redoubts arises, the Duke of Antioch often calls
  upon the famed Stoßtruppen forces of the Free State of
  Prussia. These elite units often operate in deep forward
  positions, and quite often they carry secret orders or
  specific missions from the Princes of the Church or the
  New Antioch High Command.
  The Free State Shocktroopers are selected and trained
  specifically to perform lightning assaults, master the
  firearms of close assault, and operate in Fireteams that
  are perfectly synchronised in their combined arms
  tactics. Admittance to this elite group is strictly by merit.
  All members must be decorated athletes, under 25 years
  of age, unmarried and must have demonstrated a high
  level of aggression on the battlefield. Of all the soldiers
  serving Prussia, Stoßtruppen have by far the highest
  casualty rate. When inducted into the ranks, all swear an
  oath at the Köningsber Cathedral: “To each, his own, to
  me, death”.
  Rules
  The Stoßtrupp of the Free State of Prussia warband has
  the following special rules:
  ; Expert Fireteams: You may have up to three
  FIRETEAMS from the New Antioch Fireteams
  feature.
  ; Masters of the Grenade: Models of the
  Stoßtruppen Warband add 4” range to all of their
  GRENADE weapons.
  ; Forward Positions: Up to two Shocktroops can
  have the Keyword INFILTRATOR at the cost of
  +10 ducats per model.
  ; Rapid Assault: At the cost of +5 ducats per
  model, any Shocktroopers and Lieutenants may add
  +1 DICE to all their Dash ACTIONS.
  ; Specialised Equipment: This warband has
  LIMIT:4 for Submachine guns. Automatic
  Shotguns and Automatic Pistols are not limited
  to ELITE. The warband may have no Grenade
  Launchers and only one Machine Gun.
  ; Troop Selection: The warband must have at
  least two shocktroopers and can have up to eight.
  the warband can have only one mechanised heavy
  infantry, one sniper priest and no trench moles.
  ; Lightly-armoured: Apart from mechanised
  heavy infantry and the lieutenant, no model in
  the warband can be equipped with reinforced or
  machine armour.
  ; Light Melee: Prussian shocktroopers lose the
  Assault Drill ability.

  Prussian Special Equipment
  Tank-splitter sword 15 ducats
  It takes years of gruelling Mensur practice and field drills to acquire the required precision and speed to use the specialist
  tank-splitter swords of the Gardekorps. Despite their great size (often over 6 feet long!) they are remarkably light, and due
  to the large quantities of Orichalcum used in their forging process, they are virtually unbreakable. They are often used to
  disable tanks and other armoured vehicles by either slicing their armour open or disabling them with an accurate swing
  to sever their tracks. Before any battle they are treated with a special metal-melting chemical compound which melts the
  armour, making it far deadlier against armoured targets than those who wear none.

  as well as dreams of acquiring valuable loot to send back
  to their island home, but above all to get their hands on
  some Devil-worshippers!
  The Heretic submarine fleet harries the shores of the
  Kingdom constantly, carrying off their young in chains
  to be sacrificed in the dark altars of the Arch-devils and
  their hatred towards Hell’s forces runs deep. The fleet
  of Britain and their famed moving fortress are reserved
  in guarding their own shores, causing friction and
  resentment among their northern neighbours, whose
  coastal defences are far less comprehensive. As is the
  tradition in Alba, these warbands favour close quarters
  combat and fierce charges over defence and long-range
  attacks.

  The Kingdom of Alba Assault Detachment has the

  Warband Variant:
  Expeditionary Forces of
  Abyssinia
  Most of what was once the ancient realm of Egypt now
  rests under the Shadow of Hell and the stronghold
  of the servants of the Prince of Greed, who has long
  dreamed of plundering the whole continent of its riches.
  Beautiful Alexandria and even mighty Cairo have fallen,
  their ports serving as anchorage for the heretic fleet and
  mustering grounds for Hell’s legions as they strike south
  and west.
  But thus far, Mammon’s plans to sweep across the
  northern coast of Africa all the way to Mali and Axum
  has been frustrated. For this front is every bit as bitterly
  contested as the European theatre of war. Here the
  heretic legions are opposed by a coalition of Nubia,
  Numidia and the Solomonic Empire of Abyssinia
  (more commonly known as the Ethiopian Empire in
  Africa) that have thrown their lot together to resist
  the invader. Blood stains the waters of the Nile as the
  coalition struggles to contain the grinding offensives of
  Mammon’s Legion of the Ten Golden Horns. The plan
  of the Prince of Greed is two-fold: to overcome the holy
  churches of Lalibela – desecrating and auctioning off
  the legendary relics within the churches and cathedrals
  of Axum – and to claim the fabled gold mines of the
  Queen of Sheba for himself, which he covets beyond any
  other treasure trove on Earth.
  War has honed the soldiers of Ethiopia into masters
  of mobile warfare and taking the enemy on in loose
  formation, a style of fighting well-suited to their rugged
  country where scarce roads restrict the movements of
  large armies. Most levies fight armed with rifles, seeking
  to close in on the enemy to ensure the effectiveness of
  their volleys; while the Chewa are the warrior-elite,
  trained in hand-to-hand combat since childhood.
  They are encouraged to take on lions and other fierce
  predators as part of their upbringing, and warriors that
  have taken down a male lion single-handedly have the
  honour of wearing its mane as a headdress. Their famed
  war cry “Together! Together!” is often the last thing the
  invaders hear.
  Claiming a direct lineage from the legendary queen of
  Sheba and King Solomon, the Emperors of Abyssinia
  are staunch members of the Faithful alliance, and the
  representative of the African continent in the Sword
  Congress of Vienna. It is a matter of pride and prestige
  to the House of Solomon that the tithe to New Antioch
  is met punctually. So once in seven years the Negarit war
  drums sound the kitet, the call to arms. The volunteers
  gather at Axum, the spiritual capital of the nation, where
  the Ark of the Covenant is said to be kept under the
  watchful eyes of warrior monks who are born to their
  role and never leave their post.
  There is never any lack of warriors willing to join the
  expeditionary force to aid New Antioch. Adventure,
  unrivalled status given to those who go to serve the Duke
  and the chance to fight the enemy in their heartlands
  ensures that the bravest young soldiers compete for the
  chance to join the expeditionary force.
  Before being accepted into this force, all volunteers
  to New Antioch must make a pilgrimage to Abuna
  Yemata Guh, the chapel that rests on a mountainside
  at a dizzying height of some 8500 feet. It is the
  most inaccessible place of worship in the world, and
  volunteers must travel to receive the blessing from this
  shrine in the sky carrying their full military kit and gear.
  Miraculously, there have been exceedingly few deaths
  caused by soldiers losing their footing and plummeting
  to their deaths. Each one of those who have fallen have
  been found to be a heretic infiltrator, and their broken
  and rotting bodies are left unburied as a warning to those
  traitors who would defile the sanctity of the shrine.
  Once the pilgrimage is done, the forces assemble and
  are laden with gold, silver, precious stones, icons and
  holy relics as gifts from the Emperor to the Duke. The
  warriors of the Emperor march to the hidden ports of
  the coast that are still free of the enemy. There is no
  land route for the warriors of Ethiopia to reach the
  Principality and the Heretic Fleet dominates both the
  Erythraean Sea and the Red Sea, leaving the perilous
  crossing of the mediterranean as the only viable option.
  Thus there is the war on the waves of the Mediterranean
  as the Faithful fleet clashes with heretic dreadnoughts.
  Ships will be sunk and the gold from the mines of the
  Queen of Sheba is lost to the sea, but when the songs
  and drums of the warriors of Solomonic Throne can be
  heard in the harbour and echoing on the famed walls of
  New Antioch, the citizens know that aid has come once
  more.
  Fewer than one in ten volunteers ever return to the
  rock-hewn Churches of Lalibela to give thanks for their
  deliverance. The rest give their lives in brutal battles in
  No Man’s Land, like countless millions before them. In
  the eyes of these survivors one can catch a glimpse of the
  horrors that have scarred them for life.

  The Cult of the
  Black Grail
  pidemics of typhus, malaria, typhoid,
  smallpox, yellow-fever, pneumonia, trench
  fever, Markisian disease and countless
  others ravage the trenches and battlefields
  of the Great War, but they all pale in
  comparison to the most dreaded of them all: the Black
  Grail.
  Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, stands apart from the
  other lords of Hell, who act mainly through their mortal
  followers. Instead, when he periodically gains supremacy
  in the bitter power struggles of the archfiends, he sends
  forth his deadliest curse.
  Infused with demonic essence from the bowels of
  the seventh layer of Hell, where the putrid fortress of
  Beelzebub stands, spews forth a torrent of demonic
  hell-flies, scorpions, locusts and other infernal insects.
  The Hellgate opens and a veritable tidal wave of foulness
  emerges, flowing across the land at startling speed,
  consuming everything and leaving indescribable horror
  in its wake. After nine days the insect swarm exhausts
  itself, devouring its own in its insatiable hunger.
  The Black Grail is indiscriminate in its hatred of
  all living things: its infections can spread to virtually
  any living biological matter, which bursts forth with
  tumours, boils and weeping pustules. Puddles and ponds
  of melted flesh are left in its wake, endless mouths left
  screaming in their agony, for the Black Grail destroys
  the body but leaves the mind intact to suffer. The
  Scientist-Priests of the Church and the Alchemists
  of the Sultanate fervently look for a way to inoculate
  their people against this foulest of diseases, but thus
  far they are without success. The only answer is to burn
  the infected settlements with specially-constructed
  flamethrower tanks that use holy anointing oil as the fuel
  for their weapons.
  But if this is not done, or the countermeasures are too
  late, what happens next is even worse: bodies of men,
  horses, dogs, insects and other animals of every kind that
  are infected by the Black Grail lurch to their feet, driven
  by a demonic will. Not living, not dead, they become
  vessels to spread the corruption of their master ever
  further, forming warbands that strive to find and infect
  life of any kind. They also gather things that mortals
  value and bring this loot as well as grisly trophies to the
  feet of the idols of Beelzebub they erect. Thus the Cult
  of the Black Grail mocks the devotions of the Faithful
  and their prayers.
  At the head of such warbands stand the knights of the
  Order of the Fly: those most depraved men and women
  who willingly embrace the Black Grail and whose
  devotion Beelzebub finds sufficient. They are granted
  weapons, armour and equipment corrupted by the hand
  of the Archfiend in exchange for sacrifices brought to
  the altars of Beelzebub, which these warbands build
  wherever they go, objects of grisly horror constructed
  from the remains of their victims shaped into the form
  of monstrous flies.

  Infection Markers: Some attacks by the weaponry
  of the Black Grail causes their opponents to suffer
  INFECTION MARKERS. These work in a similar
  fashion to BLOOD MARKERS. INFECTION MARKERS
  can be used to modify dice rolls exactly like BLOOD
  MARKERS (i.e. ACTION rolls and injury rolls and used
  in Bloodbaths). Use a different coloured dice (the more
  disgusting the better!) to indicate these markers and
  place them next to the infected model.
  A model may have up to six INFECTION MARKERS
  and six BLOOD MARKERS at the same time. If a model
  had any INFECTION MARKERS before, but has none
  when it is Activated, no new ones are added to the
  model – though it can still be re-infected by further
  attacks if a model has one or more INFECTION
  MARKERS when activated, it gains +1 INFECTION
  MARKER.
  Morale: Fighting against the Black Grail is a terrifying
  prospect. Enemy Warbands roll Morale Tests with -1
  DICE when fighting a Black Grail Warband. The Court
  Warbands and other Black Grail Warbands ignore this
  penalty.

  Black Grail Special Weapons & Equipment
  The following weapons, armour and equipment are exclusively available to the Black Grail Warband.
  Infested Rifle
  Armour offers little protection against the horrid, tainted bullets of this rifle, polluted by the power of Beelzebub himself.
  The bullets are semi-sentient, flying through the tiniest of chink in any armour.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Infested Rifle 2-handed 18” - -
  Rules: When resolving injuries for this weapon, the total modifier to injuries from a model’s armour (including
  shields) is reduced by 1. Thus Reinforced Armour, for example, only offers a -1 modifier to injury rolls this weapon
  causes.
  Corruption Belcher
  Corruption Belchers spew forth noxious gas and corrosive fumes captured from the Bolgias of the putrid swamps of the
  seventh layer of Hell.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Corruption Belcher 2-handed 8” - GAS
  Rules: This weapon automatically hits and it ignores armour. Because this weapon has the Keyword GAS, it inflicts an
  additional BLOOD MARKER on a hit.
  Putrid Shotgun
  Loaded with corroded demon-possessed winged shot filled with infected parasite larvae, the rounds of the Putrid Shotguns
  are almost impossible to avoid. This repulsive weapon is nicknamed ‘blunderpus’ by the New Antioch troops.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Putrid Shotgun 2-handed 12” +1D to Attacks ASSAULT
  Rules: This weapon rolls attacks with +1 DICE and causes INFECTION MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS.
  Viscera Cannon
  This heavy firearm is the most loathsome and repulsive of all the weapons in the arsenal of the Black Grail - and that is
  saying something, considering the stiff competition it has. A warrior armed with this pride of Beelzebub inserts its tubes
  into their own abdomen and then shoots the corrosive contents of their own innards at the enemy. It is operated by a hand
  crank that first builds pressure inside the user until they are at the point of bursting, and then releases the spray of viscera at
  their foe. The greater the amount of their own flesh the user releases, the more horrific the damage.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Viscera Cannon 2-handed 24” +2D to Attacks HEAVY
  Rules: This weapon rolls attacks with +2 DICE, as even the slightest splash can kill. After resolving an injury
  caused by this weapon, this model may choose to suffer up to three BLOOD MARKERS to inflict the same number of
  additional BLOOD MARKERS upon the target of the attack.

  Plague Blade 1-handed Melee - -

  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Beelzebub’s Axe 2-handed Melee +2D to Injury rolls HEAVY
  Rules: This weapon rolls injuries with +2 DICE, causing INFECTION MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS.
  Black Grail Shield
  The Device of the Black Grail carries the blessing of the Lord of Flies. It has a will of its own, moving to intercept any
  bullets or other projectiles that might impede the work of Beelzebub.
  Rules: This counts as a Trench Shield. In addition, when this model is targeted by a ranged attack, it can draw on the
  power of the Black Grail to disturb the flow of reality as an ACTION. If successful, the ranged attack is rolled with -2
  DICE. If this ACTION is a Critical, the ranged attack automatically misses. This can be done outside of the model’s
  Activation and can be done each time the model is targeted by a ranged attack.
  Parasite Grenades
  Gift from the Lord of the Flies, these grenades are filled with parasitic mind worms whose bites cause fever dreams and
  terrifying hallucinations. They are used to force the mortals away from the safety of defended bunkers and trenches.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords
  Grenade GRENADE 8” - ASSAULT
  Rules: If this weapon hits a model, the target is moved up to 3” in a single direction of the attacker’s choosing. This
  can be used to move the model out of cover, to fall from a high position or even into Melee Combat with their
  enemies. Models that are immune to FEAR cannot be moved by this weapon.
  Compound Eyes Helmet
  This ancient helmet fuses itself to its wearer, connecting its nerves into the compound eyes of the helmet, granting
  enhanced vision.
  Rules: This counts as a Combat Helmet. Additionally, this model increases its Ranged characteristic by +1 DICE.
  Grail Devotee
  Given birth by Matagot Hags after devouring living victims whole, these diminutive thralls are driven by an
  unspeakable thirst for fluids tainted by the Black Grail. They attach themselves to the nobles of the Order of the Fly,
  endlessly begging for any secretion or discharge of fluid their master might be able to spare. Nobles of the Fly pass
  their ammunition and blades through the devotee’s digestive system to enhance the deadliness of their weapons.
  Rules: A single model may be accompanied by up to two Grail Devotees. For each Devotee a model is accompanied
  by, it rolls injuries with a flat +1 bonus with all of its attack ACTIONS. Note that although Grail Devotees can be
  represented by a model, they are not treated as models for any rules purposes. As equipment, they must remain
  stationary and wholly on the base of the model that they accompany.

  0-4 Heralds of Beelzebub (Cost: 50 ducats)
  Some victims of the Black Grail suffer a far worse fate than becoming a Thrall. They are
  bestowed with the black honour by being melded with hell-flies, growing into a grotesque
  winged insect made of bloated flesh. After this torturous metamorphosis they take to air as
  Heralds of Beelzebub, the winged squires and scouts of the Order of the Fly. Their vestigial
  human bodies are still conscious as they are slowly eaten from within to be used as fuel by the
  Herald, all the while their warped bodies fight for the glory of Hell against their will.
  The Heralds are the vanguard in any assault of the Black Grail, and the ear-numbing
  otherworldly drone of their wings strikes terror in any defender, breaking their focus and
  sapping their willpower. Heralds wield discarded weapons, contaminated with horrible
  worms that churn through them, which in turn infect their victims. Each diseased bullet

  ; Toxic: This model ignores any additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the

  ; Skirmisher: Heralds are fast and elusive, and thus have the Keyword
  SKIRMISHER. SKIRMISHERS can move D3” when they are targeted by or would
  intercept a Charge, unless they are in Melee Combat or they are Down. This helps
  them keep out of reach of close-range threats.

  cost to the forces of the Great Tyrant YHWH. Even the
  great Paladin Engelier, the Sword of Heaven, died when
  confronting the might of a Hegemon.
  With the ascension of a Hegemon, the hideous power
  of the Black Grail is exalted. Beelzebub grows sleek and
  fat, and like a magnanimous king, bestowing blessings
  and gifts upon his most favoured children. Beelzebub’s
  insidious grip over his Grail Thralls greatly increases.
  They move with more grace and the exalted blessings of
  the Grail opens their ruined minds, allowing them to
  truly witness the rotting glory of the Lord of the Flies,
  enabling them to understand more complex weaponry.
  In turn, the nobles that make up the ranks of the Order
  of the Fly are given kingly gifts from their mighty liege.
  Full of the ascendant power of the Black Grail, how
  miserable they become when their Hegemon lord falls in
  battle. Each Hegemon is unique, and when slain, it can
  never be re-created. The ecstasy of the Plague Knights
  in the service of their dread ruler sinks into the deepest
  despair from which there is no escape. Their strain of the
  Black Grail is shunned by others of their kind and they
  are no longer welcome at Ekron, the City of Beelzebub:
  they are cast out from the Order of the Fly for their
  failure. The Hegemon’s strain of disease continues
  spreading and creating thralls, but they are born into
  a world bereft of their sires, leaving them hopeless and
  desolated.
  The eyes of the Plague Knights continuously weep cold
  black blood as they cry for their lost Dark Paradise that
  will never be again. The tantalising dream of a great
  flood of pestilence that cleanses the earth is lost forever.
  Their mournful wails echo and reverberate through No
  Man’s Land, a cry of sorrow deeper than any mortal can
  feel, and agonising rage of black hatred that no mortal
  comprehends. They compose mournful paeans to their
  lost Hegemon -beautiful yet disturbing songs that
  promise nothing but never-ending death.
  Such shattered remains of the once-mighty legions of
  the Hegemon take their vengeance on any opponent
  regardless of their allegiance, even throwing themselves
  at other Black Grail warbands in futile acts of regret,
  trying to feel pain that would at least momentarily dull
  their aching feeling of loss. But no such hope exists in
  their eternal damnation.
  These bands made up of the strains of fallen Hegemons’
  once-mighty legions form everlasting funeral processions
  for their dead masters. The echo of their dirges
  accompanies their solemn steps, taking them from
  nowhere to nowhere. Their eyes are forever stained by
  the foul tears of the Black Grail and their skin turns
  black and sloughs off, hanging in tatters like funereal
  garb. They seek lost artefacts and broken shards of
  armour and weapons of their lost liege, fashioning
  disturbing and rusted jewellery from these remains
  where the Hegemon’s power still lingers beyond the
  grave. Few things that haunt No Man’s Land are more
  dangerous – or ghastlier – than these corruption-ridden
  echoes of the dark past, the funeral processions that last
  until time itself is no more.
  The Dirge Special Rules
  The warband has the following special rules:
  ; The Executor: The warband must include an
  Executor (use Plague Knight characteristics) who
  has the Keyword TOUGH and a Ranged characteristic
  of +1 DICE. The Executor costs 80 ducats.
  ; The Lamenters: The warband can include up
  to three Plague Knights (including the Executor)
  known as The Lamenters.
  ; The Fallen: The warband cannot include a Lord
  of Tumours or Amalgam, for all were slain a long
  time ago.
  ; The Lost: The warband may only include a
  maximum of two Hounds (known as Wailers) and
  a maximum of two Heralds of Beelzebub (called
  Weepers).
  ; The Bereaved: The Grail Thralls and Fly Thralls
  of the warband are called the Bereaved. Bereaved
  have a Ranged characteristic of +0 DICE and cost
  30 ducats each. Grail Thralls (but not Fly Thralls)
  can be equipped with ranged weapons, standards
  and musical instruments from the Black Grail
  Armoury.
  ; Dishonoured: No model in the warband may
  carry a Black Grail Shield or Beelzebub’s Axe. The
  Lord of the Flies does not suffer failed knights to
  carry his device.
  ; Hegemon’s Last Blessing: This warband has
  Plague Blade LIMIT:3, Putrid Shotgun LIMIT:3
  and Viscera Cannon LIMIT:3. Non-ELITE
  models can be equipped with Viscera Cannons.

  The Court of the
  Seven-Headed Serpent
  utting from eternally belching plumes of
  stinking, corrosive smoke is the Iron City
  of Dis; and atop its shrieking, black keep can
  be found the Infernal War Council. There sits
  seven of the greatest, most wicked and
  cunning of Arch-Devils, each representing
  one of the Seven Mortal Sins made manifest. They are
  the rulers of the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent
  which oversees Hell’s war against Creation on Earth.
  Each is known as one of the Heads of the Serpent,
  and ultimately it is their commands that dictate all the
  military forces of the Great War in the service of the
  infernal hierarchy.
  In this twisted, treacherous and ever-shifting political
  arena, even the mightiest of Devils rarely sit at the great
  War Council for long. Towering statues of the Serpent
  Heads representing Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Greed,
  Sloth and Lust are erected in Dis by slavering work gangs
  of yoke fiends, only to be torn down again and crushed
  into rubble as new Devil Lords rise to the pinnacle of
  power by trampling over their rivals.
  The hierarchy of the Court is anything but stable: only
  Mammon is said to have held the position of the Serpent
  Head of Greed almost without break for the duration
  of the entire Great War. Other positions have seen a
  bewildering parade of dukes, marquises, margraves,
  barons and baronesses, paramounts, princes, lords,
  ladies, earls and myriad other high nobles that make up
  the infernal hierarchy. This whirlwind of political glory,
  followed by utter ruin, is reflected as shifts of power
  amongst their mortal followers on earth. The Council
  operates on majority vote and often with the thinnest
  of margins. It takes very little for an ambitious prince or
  princess of Hell to make so many enemies that they are
  deposed and their wings torn, forced them to begin their
  ascent from the bottom once more, with the mockery of
  their rivals burning them like venom.
  Countless envious pretenders work against the Heads of
  the Serpent, seeking to replace them and gain the glory
  and prestige that comes with such a lofty position. The
  might of the demons also waxes and wanes based on how
  many mortal followers they can corrupt to their cause,
  and thus there is a constant change in which demon
  lords can don one of the seven serpent-headed crowns.
  While Beelzebub is the most powerful Devil of Gluttony
  by far, the Lord of the Flies scorns his rightful place at
  the Court, waging his battle against creation through his
  Black Grail instead. This leaves his seat open so the lesser
  fallen angels can struggle for the honour of sitting on the
  Hungry Throne.
  Upon the commands of the Court, the warbands of
  Hell gather at the Hellgate and strike out to blight our
  unhappy world. Yoke fiends muster under the banners
  of their praetors and sorcerers. The shattered forms of
  the Hell Knights are forced into their suits of armour,
  emerging from their fiery tombs where their bodies
  are kept crushed under mighty, ever-turning slabs of
  black basalt while they are not serving in the war effort.
  Desecrated Saints are brought forth to act as unholy war
  altars that pollute and pervert the land which they travel
  over. Ahead of the warbands fly Pit Locusts, the clatter
  of their wings heralding the coming of the Court, their
  poison stings leaving burns that cannot be healed. And
  sometimes, when the deathly omens in Hell’s burning
  sky and black stars are favourable, a Hunter of the Lefthand Path will join a warband as they strike out from
  the Mouth of Hell. As the warband marches to join
  the Great War, joyous and triumphant music played by
  unseen hands can be heard at these times, for taking part
  in one of these hunts is seen as a great privilege within
  the Sheol.
  Before most warbands, the whips of the yoke fiends drive
  living human slave soldiers of the Court known as the
  wretched. These unfortunate souls possess not a drop of
  demon blood. They act as disposable shock troops or are
  used as subjects of torture to power the Goetic magic of
  J
  97
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  the sorcerers and other users of the dark arts. Captured
  during one of the hunts of the Court, sold to the devils
  in the heretic domains or having the misfortune to
  have foolishly pushed through in the places where the
  borders of the world are thin, their minds are scarred
  by witnessing the horror of damnation while still alive.
  Willing to do anything to escape their fate a million
  times worse than death, they grasp at the thinnest of
  straws. Should a wretch bring down a mighty opponent,
  the Law of Hell is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom,
  in memory and honour of the First Rebellion when
  there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels painted
  the firmament red.
  The Court and the Great War
  When the Gate of Hell was opened by the Ultimate
  Heresy of the Templars, it was the warbands of the
  Court that poured out and took the Levant by the
  storm, long before the first Heretic Legion was ever
  formed. They fell upon the people of the Middle East,
  Asia and Europa. They crushed the mortal armies sent
  against them like fire burning dry chaff. Only at Antioch
  and at the Iron Wall were they eventually checked,
  though at a terrible cost. Meanwhile, awed even by these
  least of Hell’s servants, countless men and women fell
  to their knees at the sight of the dark splendour of the
  Court and worshipped them as gods. Those with truly
  wicked hearts were spared and they became the first
  heretics. Eventually their numbers would swell into the
  millions who now fill the teeming cities and domains
  under the shadow of the Hellgate.
  Being both of the material world and of the world of
  spirit, the Court’s foot soldiers can march to make war
  on Earth without a fear of divine retribution as they do
  not break the Covenant of Hell. The Court also carefully
  limits the size of these warbands, so that most of the
  suffering and dying of the Great War is done by mortals,
  both to spite the God-Tyrant YHWH, but also to
  enhance their own power, as more humans are corrupted
  and die in the rebellion, the more God’s plan is disturbed
  and the greater the power of the devils waxes.
  The missions of the Court against the Faithful do not
  follow the same logic as one a mortal commander
  might have. A mighty praetor could strike at a militarily
  insignificant village only to kill a new-born future saint,
  betray their own mortal followers by suddenly falling
  upon some unsuspecting heretic settlement or even clash
  with a warband of a rival Head of the Serpent. The wise
  do not question the motives of Hell’s rage and Heretics
  accept these occasional attacks against their forces as
  a fitting judgement for their lack of success in the war
  against the Faithful.

  This wheel-lock hunting rifle is produced in the forges of the demon Sabnock, the Great Marquis of War. Made of both
  infernal and earthly metals and materials, it exists simultaneously in the twisted dimension of Hell as well as on Earth.
  A thing that should not be, the shots of this firearm pervert the laws of God, so taking cover from its bullets and firing over

  Goetic Powers & Spells
  Many of the warriors of the Court have access to Goetic abilities – Powers and Spells which use the suffering of
  mortals as spiritual energy to unleash the reality-bending powers of the Demons. As God’s plan for the universe is
  disrupted and perverted, the infernal sorcerers and other demonic creatures can use the released primordial energy
  of Creation to alter reality. Demons have to be quick, however: God’s omnipotence will soon reassert itself and the
  opportunity for Demons to disturb the world is lost. Thus infernal creatures have a continuous and growing need for
  human sacrifices, pain and endless warfare to enable their supernatural powers.
  Goetic Spells are marked with the Keyword GOETIC (x) where the number in brackets indicates how many BLOOD
  MARKERS will have to be spent to trigger the effect of the Spell. If multiple numbers or a range of numbers are listed
  in the brackets, any one of those numbers can be chosen. These BLOOD MARKERS can be taken from any model
  currently taking part in the battle, be they friendly or enemy models. However, they must come from models that do
  not have the Keyword DEMONIC or BLACK GRAIL.
  BLOOD MARKERS used this way are removed from the game and the described effect of the Goetic Spell or ability
  then takes effect as described – no ACTION roll is needed, unless outlined in the spell. Despite not requiring an
  ACTION roll, Goetic Spells are ACTIONS and, as with other ACTIONS, spells can only be used by the model once per
  Activation. Some Goetic Powers are not marked with the Keyword GOETIC (x). These powers are typically passive
  abilities.
  Seven Deadly Sins
  Many of the warriors of the Court have access to a selection of devastating Spells and other Powers as detailed in the
  list below which can be purchased at the indicated cost when the model is initially purchased. Depending on the
  type of model and which Deadly Sin the warband is dedicated to, the selection available to you may vary. All such
  limitations are clearly marked below.

  Burning Inferno 15 ducats
  As a Ranged Attack ACTION with GOETIC (1-3) spell the Sorcerer opens a portal to the Lake of Fire and draws
  forth a great screaming ball of infernal lava mixed with damned souls. Select a 1x1mm point within 36” that the
  Sorcerer can see. Next, make a ranged attack ACTION: this attack suffers penalties for Long Range but not for Cover.
  If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the fireball lands 1” away from its intended location, multiplied by the number
  representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the fireball lands 2” away, as 7-5=2). The direction
  is decided by your opponent. The Burning Inferno has the Keyword BLAST X”, where X is the amount of BLOOD
  MARKERS spent. Additionally, if the Burning Inferno lands directly on top of a model, it ignores that model’s armour.
  This attack has the Keyword FIRE.

  Call of Flesh 15 ducats
  None can resist the call of Lust.

  weight and terrifying recoil, and thus they are most often used by Communicants or Anointed who possess the supernatural
  strength to wield such weapons.

  Flamethrower
  A flamethrower is a terrifying weapon capable of projecting great streams of fire and flammable liquids at a distance. It
  is ideal for clearing bunkers, trenches and other fortifications, killing in a most horrific way. Consequently, it is greatly
  favoured by the Heretic forces.

  All these weapons can be used by a model carrying them to perform a Melee Attack ACTION. Roll on the Action
  Success Chart to see if the attack hits. Add the number of +/-DICE as indicated by the Melee characteristics entry
  for the model in the relevant Warband List.
  Unarmed
  Fighting unarmed in the Great War is nigh-suicidal, but some troops carry no melee weapons or their weapons have been
  lost in the heat of the battle. In such cases, a warrior is forced to defend themselves with fists, kicks and their bare teeth.
  Name Type Range Modifiers Keywords

  These rules simply cover all instances where the model fights unarmed and has no other Melee Actions in their
  profile.
  Knife/Dagger
  Virtually all soldiers carry a trench knife, dagger or other kind of blade for close quarter engagements. It may lack the
  devastating power of a great maul or other heavier melee weapons, but this humble weapon has taken countless lives
  during the Great War.

  Trench Clubs are one of the most common weapons of the Great War, as melee combat is frequent and brutal. Usually

  Sacrificial Knife
  Terrifying blades blessed by the hand of a greater devil, these knives are used in Heretic rituals to sacrifice captives to the

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Armour
  A model can wear only one suit of armour at a time. Shields can be combined with any Armour unless otherwise
  indicated.
  Trench Shield
  Shields used in trench warfare are made of steel reinforced with Orichalcum to allow them to withstand even high-calibre
  bullets, or from metal mined from Infernal bedrock and shaped in the armouries of Pandæmonium, the Capital of Hell.
  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat, and cannot be switched out. Grants -1 to
  all injury rolls against the model. This bonus stacks with any armour the model wears, unless otherwise indicated. For
  the purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Trench Shield does not take a
  hand to wield but still functions as normal.
  Heavy Ballistic Shield
  These massive shields are made of aramid fibre mesh and orichalcum-steel alloy. They are so heavy that they can only be
  carried by Heavy Mechanized infantry, and even then they are too cumbersome to be used in fast paced melee. They are
  mainly used for protection during their ponderous advance towards the enemy.
  Rules: Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat and cannot be switched out. The target
  is always considered to be in Cover when shot, and counts as fighting behind a defended obstacle when an enemy
  charges them. These bonuses cannot be combined with Polearms, shovels, cover or defended obstacles. For the
  purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Heavy Ballstic Shield does not take a
  hand to wield but still functions as normal.
  Standard Armour
  With the advancements in metallurgy and technology, both Faithful and Heretic armies are well-equipped with suits of
  alloy armour that can withstand an impact from a bullet or turn aside the sharpest of blades. Standard armour is usually
  mass-produced, but highly effective even against high-calibre weapons.
  Rules: -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model. Can be combined with any shield.
  Reinforced Armour
  Reinforced armour is a master-crafted suit made individually for the most important and elite troops. Each one is richly
  decorated and often carries the personal device of the warrior who wears it.
  Rules: Grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour.
  Machine Armour
  Combining the rarest of divine metal alloys and the latest technology of New Antioch, Machine Armour makes its wearer
  a virtual mobile tank.
  Rules: Grants a -3 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour, and treats Down Injury results as
  a Minor Hit instead (note that the TOUGH Keyword ability to avoid Out of Action with Down overrides this). Due
  to its bulk the wearer rolls D3 for a charge extra distance instead of D6. Machine armour cannot be combined with
  any shield. Models wearing Machine Armour may have a base size of 40mm if you wish, unless the model wearing it is
  already on 50mm or bigger base.
  If worn by a model that is not part of a New Antioch force/subfaction, the only bonus the armour gives is the -3
  injury modifier, as the chemical treatment that allows the wearer to withstand the rigors of the armour is a carefully
  guarded military secret. D3 charge distance remains in force.

  Holy Icon Shield
  These shields are made from icons that have performed miracles. Mounted on blessed wood, they are harder than any steel
  and virtually indestructible. Only the most revered fighters in the service of the Church ever carry one.
  Rules: Takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat. Grants -1 to all injury rolls against the model. This
  shield is effective even against weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.
  Holy Icon Armour
  Only a few of these suits of armour exist in all of Christendom. Covered with miraculous icons this suit of armour is
  protected by the very hand of Heaven and its wearer can withstand even direct hits from artillery.

  weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.
  129
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Equipment
  Unless otherwise noted a model can only carry one piece equipment of the same type. Models may carry multiple
  different types of equipment, however.
  Combat Helmet
  The simple combat helmet has proven its value on the battlefield time and again.
  Rules: Ignores additional BLOOD MARKERS caused by the Keyword SHRAPNEL.
  Iron Capirote
  A conical helmet blessed by the Church and often containing a fragment of a relic. Iron Capirotes shield their wearers from
  the psychological horror of war and allow them to face creatures from the pits of Hell unflinchingly.
  Rules: Negates the additional BLOOD MARKERS from weapons with SHRAPNEL Keyword. Makes the model
  immune to the effects of FEAR.
  Medi-kit
  Battlefield first aid has brought many soldiers back from the brink of death. Blessed ointments can seal fatal wounds
  completely, while the black blood of demons used by twisted heretic medics allows mangled troops to return to the fray.
  Rules: Models with a Medi-kit can take a RISKY ACTION to remove one BLOOD MARKER from any one friendly
  model (including themselves) within 1” range or allow one friendly model (including themselves) that is Down to
  regain their footing.
  Gas Mask
  Mustard Gas, phosgene, chlorine as well as noxious fumes from the bolgias of Hell plague the battlefield. The Gas Mask
  allows soldiers to withstand such attacks.
  Rules: Negates the extra BLOOD MARKER from attacks with the keyword GAS. Any such attacks suffer -1 DICE
  penalty to all injury rolls.
  Holy Relic
  Due to the threat to all Creation, the churches, cathedrals and basilicas have emptied their reliquaries and distributed
  their relics to the frontline troops to aid them in their battle against the damned.
  Rules: This model starts each game with +1 BLESSING MARKER.
  Armour-Piercing Bullets
  Advanced armour technology has forced the armouries of the Great War to forge new types of bullets. Expensive and
  labour-intensive to produce, these hardened tungsten rounds are more effective against battlefield armour.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
  with the following ability: Reduce the injury penalty from Armour and Shields by 1 until the end of the battle.
  Keyword: CONSUMABLE.
  Dum-Dum Bullets
  These hollow-point bullets are far more likely to cause fatal wounds than standard ammunition.

  Tracer Bullets
  Tracer bullets allow soldiers to adjust their aim efficiently.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item to grant a rifle or pistol weapon that they are equipped
  with +1D to hit with ranged attacks until the end of the battle. Keywords: CONSUMABLE.
  Sniper Scope
  These optical aiming devices are favoured by Snipers to aid in their aiming at long distances.
  Rules: Negates the penalty for Long Range if the model has not moved during this Activation. Only usable with rifles
  (i.e. weapons which have the Keyword rifle in their name).
  Shovel
  Battlefield shovel allows troops to dig in and fight from cover in virtually any battlefield.
  Rules: A model equipped with a shovel always starts the game in cover if deployed on ground level, even if placed
  in open terrain. As soon as the model moves, it is no longer in cover. A model that is covered in this way retains the
  benefit of Cover even if the attacking model has an unobstructed view of it. If a model equipped with a shovel has
  two hands free, it can use it in Melee Combat as if it were a Trench Club.
  Troop Flag
  Most warbands and units carry banners, flags, standards, pennants or other symbols to rally the troops.
  Rules: Grants +1 DICE for all Morale tests as long as the model with the flag is not Down or Out of Action.
  Requires one hand to use.
  Martyrdom Pills
  Martyrdom pills are a potent mixture of mind-altering drugs and chemicals that inure a soldier against all pain and
  injury. However, it takes a tremendous toll on the body.
  Rules: Before the battle begins, a model may use this item. If it does, injuries rolled against it suffer -1 DICE until
  the end of the battle and the model is not affected by FEAR. Keywords: CONSUMABLE.
  Unholy Trinket
  Rules: When a model equipped with an Unholy Trinket fails a RISKY ACTION, that model may use this item. If it
  does, its Activation is not ended. Keyword: CONSUMABLE.
  Unholy Relic
  An artefact bestowed with unholy power. Examples include Nephilim heads, desecrated splinters of the True Cross or
  mummified body parts of fallen saints and bishops.
  Rules: A model equipped with an Unholy relic radiates a truly malignant aura and causes FEAR.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Blessed Icon
  Small icons of saints, great angels and holy warriors are a common sight amongst the Trench Pilgrims. They are hung on

  Rules: When a model equipped with a Blessed Icon fails a RISKY ACTION, that model may use this item. If it does,
  its Activation is not ended. Can be used once per battle.
  Infernal Brand Mark
  A Heretic who has made a Holy Pilgrimage into Hell itself is branded by their patron devil with an ever-burning mark.
  Mortal fire no longer has the power to harm them.
  Rules: Negates the extra BLOOD MARKER from attacks with the keyword FIRE. Any such attacks suffer -1 DICE
  penalty to all injury rolls.
  Field Shrine
  Holy reliquaries, blessed artefacts and sacred crosses are often carried to the battlefield to encourage the troops, while the
  Heretics bring idols of the Golden Calf, tortured captives or other wicked totems to bear.
  Rules: Can be placed on the battlefield in your deployment zone. Acts as three models for Morale Tests. It has a base
  size of 40mm. Can be destroyed if any type of attack hits it.
  Hellbound Soul Contract
  An infernal contract signed by a Heretic and the devil who will come to collect the damned soul when death is close. The
  mortal signatory bursts into infernal flames when seriously wounded.
  Rules: When this model is taken Out of Action, any model in melee combat with them immediately suffers +1
  BLOOD MARKER unless the model ignores damage from sources with the Keyword FIRE.
  Binoculars
  It is quite common for officers to carry finely-crafted battlefield binoculars with them on the battlefield to survey the land
  ahead, spot hidden enemy troops and observe any sign of movement.
  Rules: Any enemy Infiltrator cannot be placed closer than 16” of this model.
  Musical Instrument
  Horns, drums, trumpets, whistles, bagpipes and many other types of instruments are used extensively in the battles of the
  Great War. They can bolster the hearts of those facing the horrors of Hell – or they can recite terrifying hymns praising the
  lords of the Inferno!
  Rules: Any friendly models within 4” of the musician who is not Down can add +1 DICE to their Dash ACTIONS.
  Musical Instruments take one hand to use at all times as if it were a weapon.
  Mountaineer Kit
  This kit includes ropes, carabiners, slings, mountaineering harness and pitons to aid a soldier in overcoming almost any
  vertical obstacle.

  Scenarios
  Table Size
  Battles are fought on a table with 4’ x 4’ dimensions.
  The scenario will always indicate clearly if the table size
  differs from this.
  Setting up Terrain
  Unless the Scenario states otherwise, use the following
  rules to set up the scenarios. The player with the lower
  number of models in their force can place one of the
  following terrain pieces on the table:
  ; One Building (a tower, house etc.)
  ; One Piece of Dangerous Terrain (swamp, barbed
  wire etc.)
  ; One Piece of Difficult Terrain (forest, rocky
  ground)
  ; One Piece of Impassable terrain (12” river with a
  bridge or ford, sheer cliffs etc.) Maximum two pieces
  per battle
  ; One Hill
  ; One Fence/Wall/other defendable terrain piece
  (max one per player)
  ; 6” Section of a Trench
  Each building must be placed:
  ; at least 8” away from any table edge and
  ; at least 6” away from the nearest building
  Both players place these large terrain pieces until they
  have both placed at least three pieces each. In addition,
  both players should add six smaller terrain pieces like
  boxes, sandbags, bomb craters, wells, fountains etc.
  anywhere on the table to create additional cover.
  Objective Markers
  Some Scenarios use Objective Markers. You can use
  flags, coins, banners, beads or other suitable pieces for
  these markers.
  Before the Battle and
  Pre-Battle Abilities
  Many abilities instruct (or offer) the chance to take
  an action before the battle begins. These are called
  Pre-Battle Abilities. Unless otherwise stated, Pre-Battle
  Abilities are activated and resolved after forces have been
  assembled and the terrain has been set up, but before
  models have been deployed.
  If both players have Pre-Battle Abilities to resolve at
  the same time, each player resolves a single Pre-Battle
  Ability at a time in alternating order, starting with the
  player who will have the first turn. If multiple PreBattle Abilities belonging to the same player need to be
  resolved at the same time, the player that they belong to
  may resolve them in any order that they please (unless
  the abilities specify that they must be activated in a
  specific order). If one player has resolved all of their
  Pre-Battle Abilities, the other player may resolve the
  remainder of theirs.
  Victory Points
  Victory Points (VPs) are used to determine who wins
  and loses a battle in most scenarios. VPs are often
  awarded for objectives specific to the scenario you are
  playing and this is clearly explained in the scenario itself.
  If you are playing the Campaign, the winner always gains
  5 VPs if otherwise the result would indicate less.
  Duration of the Game
  A typical game lasts for six Game Turns. Some scenarios
  have a different duration. These cases are always clearly
  indicated in the rules for the scenario.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Forces
  Use your full Campaign Warband in this battle.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-sized battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’).
  The Table must contain five buildings such as ruined
  houses, bunkers, chapels etc. At least part of each
  building must be in the location indicated on the map
  with a Red Marker. These buildings are the Objectives of
  the scenario and score Victory Points (VPs).
  Fill the rest of the battlefield in the usual way.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators cannot be used in this Scenario.
  Deployment
  The players roll-off. The loser of the roll-off chooses
  which deployment zone will be theirs. The other
  deployment zone will be their opponent’s.
  The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at
  a time, starting with the player who has more models in
  their warband (roll-off if both have the same number of
  models).
  Models must be set up wholly within their own
  deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
  up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for four turns.
  Victory Conditions
  Keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides.
  The players accumulate VPs as follows:
  ; At the end of each turn, a player scores one VP
  for each Objective building that they have a model
  within 1” of or two VPs for each Objective building
  that they control.
  ; A player controls an Objective if the total
  number of models from their warband that are
  wholly within that building is higher than the total
  number of enemy models within 1” of the Objective
  building. A model is considered wholly within
  a building if it is entirely within the edges of the
  building’s footprint, as agreed by the players.
  ; Calculate VPs for both players and the end of the
  round and add them together. The player with the
  higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is
  a draw.
  Glorious Deeds
  Players score one Glory Point for every model that
  completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Victory
  Points for these can only be gained once – whichever
  player completes them first gets the Glory!
  ; Sniper: Take out an enemy ELITE in Cover with
  a shooting attack at Long Range.
  ; Lord of War: Take two or more enemy models
  Out of Action in a single turn with melee attacks
  with one of your own models.
  ; Cast them Down: Make an enemy fall from
  a height of 3” or more thanks to your action
  (shooting, melee, Supernatural Power etc.).
  ; Bloodletting: Make one of your enemies suffer
  a sixth BLOOD MARKER with an attack from one of
  your models.
  ; Hold your Ground: Pass a Morale Test.
  ; Suicidal Bravery: Charge two enemy models
  with one of yours during a single Activation.
  ; Resist and Bite: Take out an enemy with a model
  that is Down.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Forces
  Both players select up to six models from their warband.
  No models on 40mm+ sized bases can be included.
  If your warband must contain a specific model upon
  creation, you may field that model even if it would be
  excluded by this restriction.
  At the start of turn two, both players receive D3
  randomly selected models from their warband as
  reinforcements. These reinforcements are placed
  anywhere along the player’s own table edge but at least
  8” away from any enemy models.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-sized battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’).
  Place six markers representing Reliquaries on the table as
  indicated on the map, numbered one to six.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators can be used in this Scenario.
  Deployment
  The players roll-off. The loser of the roll-off chooses
  which deployment zone will be theirs. The other
  deployment zone will be their opponent’s.
  The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at
  a time, starting with the player who has more models in
  their warband (roll-off if both have the same number of
  models).
  Models must be set up wholly within their own
  deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
  up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for four turns.
  Victory Conditions
  Keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides.
  The players accumulate VPs as follows:
  ; No Morale tests are taken during this scenario.
  ; A player scores one VP when they have models
  touching one of the Reliquary markers and make
  a successful ACTION roll. Once the VP is claimed,
  flip the marker over to show it has been claimed this
  turn. It can no longer generate VPs this turn for you
  or your opponent.
  ; Maximum VPs that can be claimed per turn is
  four.
  ; After Turn 1 is over, remove Reliquary Markers
  1 and 2 from the table. Flip any claimed Reliquary
  Markers over to indicate they can be claimed again
  this Turn.
  ; After Turn 2 is over, remove Reliquary Markers
  3 and 4 from the table. Flip any claimed Reliquary
  Markers over to indicate they can be claimed again
  this Turn.
  ; On Turn 4 the final two Reliquary Markers
  (5 and 6) are worth 2 VPs each when claimed
  successfully.
  ; Calculate VPs for both players and the end of
  each Turn and add them together. The player with
  the higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the game
  is a draw.
  Glorious Deeds
  Players score one Glory Point for every model that
  completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Victory
  Points for these can only be gained once – whichever
  player completes them first gets the Glory!
  ; Sniper: Take out an enemy ELITE in Cover with
  a shooting attack at Long Range.
  ; Cast them Down: Make an enemy fall from

  ; Blood Sacrifice: One of your models takes at
  least three enemies out of action during the battle.
  ; Resist and Bite: Take out an enemy with a model
  that is Down.
  ; Relic Hunter: One of your models claims at least
  two different Reliquary Markers during the game.
  ; Protect the Relic: Take out an enemy that is
  touching one of the Reliquary Markers.

  Scenario 3:
  Hunt for Heroes
  139
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Forces
  Both forces can use up to 20 models from their warband.
  Each player must deploy all their ELITE models if they
  are able.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-sized battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’).
  Place three markers representing Objectives on the table
  as indicated on the map, numbered one to six.
  Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
  way.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators can be used in this Scenario.
  Deployment
  The players roll-off. The loser of the roll-off chooses
  which deployment zone will be theirs. The other
  deployment zone will be their opponent’s.
  The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at
  a time, starting with the player who has more models in
  their warband (roll-off if both have the same number of
  models).
  Models must be set up wholly within their own
  deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
  up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for four turns.
  Special Objectives
  After the deployment, in secret, both players nominate
  three enemy ELITE models as targets to be eliminated
  (unless the opponent has a smaller number of ELITES
  in which case nominate all of them). Each player also
  nominates one of their own ELITE models that must
  be kept alive until the end of the game. These score
  additional Victory Points at the end of the game as
  follows.
  Victory Conditions
  Keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides.
  The players accumulate VPs as follows:
  ; At the end of each Turn, a player scores one VP if
  they have models within 1” of any of the Objective
  buildings or two VPs if they control the Objective at
  the end of the Turn.
  ; A player controls an Objective if the total
  number of models from their warband, that are
  wholly within that building, is higher than the total
  number of enemy models within 1” of the Objective
  building. A model is considered wholly within
  a building if it is entirely within the edges of the
  building as agreed by the players.
  ; When the game ends, both players reveal the
  hidden target models.
  ; For each enemy ELITE on their list that was
  taken Out of Action, the player scores 2 VPs.
  ; If the ELITE model they indicated as the
  friendly model to be kept alive has not been
  taken Out of Action at the end of the game, the
  controlling player scores 3 VPs.
  ; Calculate VPs for both players and the end of the
  game and add them together. The player with the
  higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is
  a draw.
  Glorious Deeds
  Players score one Glory Point for every model that
  completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Victory
  Points for these can only be gained once – whichever
  player completes them first gets the Glory!
  ; Kill their Leaders: Take out all the ELITES you
  nominated as targets.
  ; Death From Above: Take out an enemy with
  a melee attack ACTION benefitting from a Diving
  Charge.
  ; King of the Hill: Control all three Objectives at
  the same time.
  ; Hold Your Ground: Pass a Morale Test.
  ; High Risk, High Reward: Your nominated
  model to be kept alive takes out one of the target
  enemy ELITES.

  Scenario 4:
  Trench Warfare
  Forces
  The larger warband is the Attacker and they use their
  entire warband. The smaller warband is the Defender
  and they can have up to half of the number of models the
  Attacker has. If both warbands have the same number of
  models, roll a dice to see who the attacker is and who the
  defender is.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-sized Battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’).
  Trenches
  The Defender places three 8”-long Trench sections
  in their Deployment Zone. They can be placed as the
  Defender wishes and can be continuous, but each section
  always counts separately for Victory Points (see below).
  Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
  way.
  Mines
  The Defender then places 12 mine markers on the
  battlefield, four which will be duds – the defender marks
  141
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Otherwise, keep a running tally of Victory Points for
  both sides. The players accumulate VPs as follows:
  ; At the end of the battle, the defender scores 2
  victory points for each trench section that has one
  of the defender’s models and no enemies in it. The
  defender scores 1 VP for each trench section that has
  one of their models, but also has one or more enemy
  models.
  ; At the end of the battle, the Attacker scores 2
  VPs for each trench section that has one or more
  of their models, but also has one or more enemy
  models.
  ; At the end of the battle the Attacker scores 3 VPs
  for each trench section that has one or more of their
  models but no enemy models. Calculate VPs at the
  end each turn for both players and the end of the
  game and add them together. The player with the
  higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is
  a draw.
  Glorious Deeds
  Players score one Glory Point for every model that
  completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Glory
  Points for these can only be gained once - whichever
  player completes them first gets the Glory Points!
  ; Survive to Tell the Tale: A model is hit by two
  mines during the battle and is not taken Out of
  Action.
  ; Into the Trenches!: Charge an enemy model in
  a trench and take it Out of Action during the same
  turn.
  ; Headshot: Retreat from melee combat with an
  enemy and then take them out with a ranged attack
  ACTION during the same Activation.
  ; Good Hunting: Take out an enemy in a trench
  with a ranged attack at Long Range.
  ; Throw them Back: As a Defender, take an
  enemy in a trench Out of Action when there were
  no defenders in the trench before you activated the
  model that takes the enemy out.
  ; Hold the Line: Pass a Morale Test.
  the duds on the side of the marker that is hidden from
  view (face down). The Defender can place the mines
  anywhere within the battlefield up to 12” away from
  their own Deployment Zone as shown, though not
  inside their own deployment zone. When any model
  comes within 2” of the centre of a mine counter (players
  can measure this distance beforehand), flip the counter
  over to see if it is a dud or not. If the mine is a dud,
  discard it immediately. If the mine is not a dud, every
  model within 3” must immediately roll on the Injury
  Chart to see what happens as a result of the exploding
  mine. The mines have the Keyword SHRAPNEL, so
  the models hit by the mine blast suffer an additional
  BLOOD MARKER unless they have protection against
  this. Afterwards, remove the mine marker. It is possible
  to trigger more than one mine at the time.
  Some models, such as New Antioch Combat Engineers
  can remove a mine counter by moving in base contact
  with it and passing a RISKY ACTION as indicated in
  their warband entry. Note that when a model attempts
  this, the mine does not explode until the result of the
  roll is determined.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators can be used in this scenario. However, the
  Attacker cannot place their infiltrators closer than 12” of
  their own deployment zone.
  Deployment
  The players then take turns to deploy one model at a
  time, starting with the attacker.
  Models must be set up wholly within their own
  deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
  up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Battle Length
  At the end of the fourth turn, the Attacker rolls1D6. On
  a roll of 1-2, the battle ends. Otherwise the game lasts
  for five turns.
  Victory Conditions
  If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their
  Morale test, the game ends and the opposing warband
  wins.

  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for five turns.
  Morale
  This is a fight to the finish, so a failed Morale Test will
  not end the battle. Instead, any warband that fails their
  Morale Test will be shaken instead. It is possible for both
  warbands to be shaken.
  Victory Conditions
  If one warband is wiped out completely the opposing
  warband wins. Otherwise, keep a running tally of
  Victory Points for both sides. The players accumulate
  Victory Points as follows:
  ; By taking out enemies you earn VPs equal to the
  ducat value of the model (including any equipment)
  divided 10, rounding any fractions up to the nearest
  full number.
  ; Mercenaries & Allies are worth three times their
  Glory Points cost as Victory Points.

  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Forces
  The players roll-off. The winner can decide to be either
  the Attacker or the Defender.
  The Defender selects up to six models from their
  warband. The Attacker selects up to 6+D3 models from
  their warband.
  At the beginning of turn two, both players receive
  D3 randomly selected models from the rest of their
  warband as reinforcements. These reinforcements are
  placed anywhere along the player’s own table edge but
  at least 8” away from any enemy models. Once the
  player has deployed their entire warband, no further
  reinforcements can be deployed.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-sized battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’).
  Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
  way.
  Starting with the Defender, players then take turns to
  place an Objective Marker until each player has placed
  three markers. Each Objective Marker must be more
  than 6” away from other Objective Markers and 6” away
  from the edge of the battlefield. Only one Objective
  Marker can be placed in the Defender’s Deployment
  Zone and none in the Attacker’s. These represent the
  Defender’s supplies that the Attacker is trying to destroy.
  The Attacker treats the Objective Markers exactly as
  enemy models and they can be charged, attacked and
  shot at. The supplies can be destroyed by any melee
  attack that hits them, or a ranged attack that hits them
  from a weapon with the Keyword HEAVY.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators can be used in this Scenario.
  Deployment
  Starting with the Defender, the players take turns to
  deploy one model at a time.
  Models must be set up wholly within their own

  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for four turns.
  Victory Conditions
  If one warband fails its Morale Test, the game ends in an
  outright victory for their opponent.
  Keep a running tally of Victory Points for both sides.
  The players accumulate VPs as follows:
  ; 1 VP is gained per enemy model taken Out of
  Action.
  ; The Attacker gains 1 VP for each Objective
  Marker that is destroyed.
  ; At the end of the battle, the Defender gains 2
  VPs for each Objective that remains on the table.
  ; Calculate VPs for both players and the end of the

  Scenario 7:
  Armoured Train
  147
  TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
  Overview
  An armoured train has been derailed. While no clear
  reason has been determined, some speculate that this
  ill-fated transport could have been sent by loyal citizens
  desperate to support their forces in the front lines.
  Others say that it was part of a military effort that
  was ambushed by enemy forces, or that it could have
  been contraband intended as a commercial venture by
  merchants seeking to profit from the demands of war.
  Truth be told, any other misfortune might have fallen
  upon it. What truly matters is that the train carried
  supplies vital to keep the engines of war up and running:
  food, ammunition, medicine and even relics—holy and
  unholy. The loss of its contents has sparked a frenzy
  and now warbands from all sides rush to claim what
  remains. Evidence of a brutal fate lies scattered across the
  landscape, with barbed wire, scattered shells and fading
  blood trails hinting at a crew that vanished without a
  trace.
  Forces
  Both forces can use up to 15 models from their warband.
  The Battlefield
  The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we
  suggest 4’ x 4’). The table must contain:
  ; A hill spanning its entire middle section, as
  indicated on the map
  ; A bridge dividing the hill in half, forming a
  tunnel that allows access to both sides of the map
  and
  ; A train with three wagons spread throughout the
  highest section of the hill.
  Both the hill and the bridge should be about 5” high.
  Models up to 125mm tall can pass under the bridge.
  Parts of each side of the hill must contain patches of
  barbed wire. The hill sides should also be considered as
  Difficult Terrain, due to the steep elevation.
  Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
  way, using models such as guard towers, ruined buildings
  etc., placing them at least 1” away from the hillsides.
  Infiltrators
  Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but must be
  deployed as normal troops.
  Deployment
  The players roll-off. The winner of the roll-off chooses
  which deployment zone will be theirs. The other
  deployment zone will be their opponent’s.
  The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at
  a time, starting with the player who has more models in
  their warband (roll-off if both have the same number of
  models).
  Models must be set up wholly within their own
  deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
  up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
  Once the players have set up their models, deployment
  ends and the battle begins.
  Then place a Gun Turret model, represented by a circled
  G, on top of the wagon at the centre of the map. Once
  placed, neither of these can be moved during the game.
  See the Field Artillery rules for the weapons’ profile and
  specifications.
  Battle Length
  The battle lasts for six turns.
  Train Wagons

The derailed train has three wagons. Each wagon is 4”
wide (W), 8” long (L) and 5” high (H). The wagons
have a set of ladders on both sides, allowing models to
climb on top of a wagon as part of their standard Move.
A wagon also provides cover to a model that is in base
contact with it.
The train was carrying supply crates, containing precious
weapons, materials and holy relics. The supply crates are
spread between the three wagons.
Place three initial markers representing Objectives
on the table as indicated on the map. These markers
represent an X quantity of supply crates inside a wagon.
The wagons are all closed, making it impossible to see
the contents inside.
A wagon can be opened from either side by a model
within 1”. The model must roll on the Action Success
Chart to force open a wagon’s door. BLOOD MARKERS
and BLESSING MARKERS can be used to hinder, or
aid, this Action.
148
TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Upon opening a wagon, the player must then roll a D3:
1 - There is one supply crate inside the wagon:
Place one Objective Marker beside the model who
opened the wagon to represent the crate and remove
the previous marker from the table
2 - There are two supply crates inside the wagon:
Place two Objective Markers beside the model
who opened the wagon to represent the crates and
remove the previous marker from the table
3 - There are three supply crates inside the wagon:
Place three Objective Markers beside the model
who opened the wagon to represent the crates and
remove the previous marker from the table.
Supply Crates

During the game, any model that ends its move in
contact with a marker can Claim it, without the need for
a roll, as long as they’re not engaged in melee combat.
The model has then Claimed a crate. A model can end
a Claim without the need for a roll at the start of the
model’s Activation, dropping the crate within 1” of the
model, in a direction of the model’s choice. The same
model cannot make a new Claim during that Activation.
A model can only Claim one crate at a time and must
immediately choose one of the three following options:
; Extract Supplies: The model picks up the crate
to start extracting it, without the need for a roll.
The crates are HEAVY and must be held with all
hands a model may have. Any weapons a model
might be carrying, or is integrated with, will be
rendered unusable while the model is extracting the
crate. As long as a model is extracting the crate, it
cannot Attack, cannot Dash and any other method
of movement (teleportation, Puppet Master etc.)
cannot be used to move the model due to the
mystical effect of the holy relics inside, other than
their standard Move.
At the end of its Activation, the model can pass the
crate it is extracting to any friendly model within 1”
range, as long as neither model is in melee combat
with an enemy model. The model receiving the crate
is considered to have ended their Activation this
turn, if it has not yet done so. A model extracting
a crate can drop it without the need for a roll or
be forced to drop it if engaged in melee combat,
dropping the crate within 1” of the model in a
direction of the model owner’s choice.
A model can also change its choice to Destroy
Supplies (see below) without the need for a roll at
any point. If a model extracting a crate moves into
contact with any table edge, it has escaped with
the crate successfully and does not return to the
table, in which case remove the Objective Marker
representing the extracted supplies from the table
and the model that extracted it.
; Destroy Supplies: The model that has Claimed
a crate, or that is extracting it, can attack it as
an ACTION. If successful, the crate is destroyed,
in which case remove the Objective Marker
representing the destroyed supplies from the table.
; Use Supplies: As an ACTION, a model that
has Claimed a crate can attempt to open it and use
the relics inside. If successful, gain a BLESSING
MARKER, in which case remove the Objective
Marker representing the used crate from the table.
An enemy model cannot attack a crate that has been
Claimed, or that is being extracted by another model,
but they can attack the model normally.
If the model that has Claimed a crate, or is extracting
it, is taken Out of Action, the crate is immediately
dropped within 3” of the fallen model, in a direction of
the enemy’s choice. If it lands in contact with another
model, the model can immediately Claim it, except if
they’re engaged in melee combat with an enemy model,
in which case the crate must be dropped again in a
different direction.
If the game ends while a model has a Claimed crate, or is
in the process of extracting it, they have failed to either
extract it, destroy it or use it, and so it does not count
towards the final VPs calculation.
Victory Conditions
If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their
Morale test, the game ends and the opposing warband
wins. Otherwise, keep a running tally of Victory Points
for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as follows:
; A player scores 3 VPs for each crate successfully
extracted from the map.
; A player scores 2 VPs for each crate destroyed
during the game.
; A player scores 1 VPs for each crate used during
the game.
Calculate VPs at the end each turn for both players and
the end of the game and add them together. The player
with the higher number of VPs wins, otherwise the game
is a draw.

Scenario 8:
Storming the Shores
151
TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Overview
The shoreline of this beach, river, lake or swamp
stands as a vital stronghold - its bunkers, trenches
and heavy emplacements forming an unyielding wall
against invasion. Guarding a crucial supply route, the
defenders rely on their fortifications and firepower to
hold the line with minimal troops, confident in the
terrain’s advantage. Yet, the attackers have taken note
of the thinly stretched defences, massing their forces in
overwhelming numbers to breach the coastal bastion.
The horizon brims with movement, the tide of war
rolling in to test the strength of the shoreline’s iron grip.
Forces
The player with the higher number of models is the
Attacker. The Attacker must declare the size of their
warband, up to sixteen models max. If the Attacker has
two or fewer ELITES, they must field all of them. The
opponent is the Defender and they can have up to half
of the total number of models the Attacker has declared,
rounded down. If both warbands have the same number
of models, roll a dice to see who the Attacker and who
the Defender is.
The Battlefield
The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we
suggest 4’ x 4’).
The Defender places three 8”-long Trench sections
in their Deployment Zone. They can be placed as the
Defender wishes and can be continuous. However, in the
division between each of the three trench sections the
Defender must place a bunker model (as indicated by the
small Red Markers on the map) of at least 4” x 4” and up
to 3” high, so that models of up to 75mm tall may enter
the bunker’s interior.
The Defender must place a Main Structure in the
location indicated on the map by a large Red Marker.
This structure can be a church, a large bunker, a tower
etc. It must be at least 6” x 6” and up to 6” high, so that
models of up to 150mm tall may enter the building’s
interior.
The Main Structure and the bunkers are the Objectives
of the scenario, hereafter referred to as Objective
Buildings, and score Victory Points (VPs).
The Defender then places three defence works
(sandbags, barricades, low wall etc.) each of which
counts as a defended obstacle and is at least 4” long
horizontally. They are max 1” high. Use the following
instructions to deploy these defence works.
; Within 18” of the centre of the battlefield
(measured to the centre).
; At least 12” away from another defence work
(measured from the centre).
; Not within or surrounded by Impassable terrain.
The Defender places either a Gun Turret or a Mortar,
represented by a circled G and a circled M, respectively,
on the scenario map, in any location within their
deployment zone. Once placed, neither of these can be
moved during the game. See the Field Artillery rules for
the weapons’ profile and specifications.
Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
way, using models such as barricades, ruined buildings,
trees, sandbags etc.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but they
cannot be within 8” of any of the Defender’s Objective
Buildings.
Deployment
The player with the higher number of models is the
Attacker. The other deployment zone will be their
opponent’s, as the Defender, with half the number of
models the Attacker has declared.
The Defender starts by deploying their models and
also placing the Gun Turret (or Mortar) where they
wish according to the parameters set below. After the
Defender has deployed their models, the Attacker
deploys theirs.
Models must be set up wholly within their own
deployment zone.
Once the players have set up their models, deployment
ends and the battle begins.
Battle Length
At the end of the fifth turn, the Attacker rolls 1D6. On a
roll of 1-2, the battle ends. Otherwise, the game lasts for
six turns.
152
TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
Unforeseen Events
These rules represent the treacherous and often
unforeseeable tides of war that can suddenly shift the
battle unexpectedly. Starting on the second turn of
combat, roll 1D6. On a roll of 1-3, a random event
occurs, otherwise the game continues until the start of
the next turn, when another roll will be required. These
events will always occur at the start of the combat turn,
before any model Activation (unless stated otherwise).
Upon the occurrence of a random event, roll another
1D6 for the Unforeseen Events chart below to see what
exactly happens and follow the directions. No more than
one random encounter will ever take place in a single
game, so after a random encounter is rolled, a player no
longer needs to roll at the start of a combat turn. The
entries below refer to the corresponding number rolled
and its respective effects:
1. Rising Fog
   Heavy fog covers the entire combat zone, drastically
   limiting visibility for all models. All Ranged Attacks
   have their total range halved, according to the weapon’s
   profile and respective modifiers that may have been
   applied (such as scopes etc.) The fog lasts for two turns
   before it dissipates.
2. Striding Mercenary
   A Mercenary appears on the ridge overlooking the shore.
   Witnessing the unfolding carnage, they decide to seize
   the opportunity and offer their services to the warband
   with the most Glory Points currently accumulated (if
   both warbands have the same number of points, roll-off
   1D6 to see whom they offer their help to. On a roll of
   1-3, the Attacker wins, and a roll of 4-6, the Defender
   wins the roll-off ). The Mercenary will offer their services
   to the warband for a single turn, even if they have already
   hired their maximum number of Mercenary models for
   1 Glory Point.
   You can choose any of the Mercenary units available
   to your warband and immediately deploy them at least
   6” away from any other model in the battlefield, but
   not within the opponent’s Deployment Zone. You can
   also deny the Mercenary’s services if you don’t have the
   required amount of points to pay them.
   At the end of the turn, the warband that they aided
   must pay them their required amount of Glory Points
   before they leave the battlefield. If the warband cannot
   (or will not) meet the Mercenary’s standard, they leave,
   but not before taking out their frustration on a random
   member of the warband (only choose among members
   of the warband who haven’t been taken Out of Action
   yet). Roll directly on the Injury Chart for this member,
   according to the Mercenary’s profile statistics for the
   attack (the opponent chooses which attack was used),
   applying any applicable modifiers.
3. Unearthed Relics
   Relics are suddenly unearthed in the battlefield. Each
   player places two Objective Markers to represent the
   relics, for a total of four, each at least 6” away from any
   Deployment Zone, at least 6” away from each other
   and at least 6” away from any model. The relics cannot
   be placed on impassable terrain or surrounded by it.
   A model that comes into base contact with the relic
   claims it. The model’s owner decides if it is a holy or
   unholy relic, according to the restriction of their faction’s
   warband. The model either gains +1 BLESSING
   MARKER (for a holy relic) or starts radiating a malignant
   aura and causes FEAR (for an unholy relic).
4. The Beast of No Man’s Land
   The scent of blood soaking the ground and the
   incessant sound of gunfire has brought the attention of
   a prowling beast. Rumours have been spreading about
   this fiend. Some say it is a stray War Beast, a hell-spawn
   abomination that escaped captivity before it could be
   made into a War Wolf. Others claim it is something
   much older, something that scarred the earth and fed
   upon its inhabitants long before the start of the war.
   Whatever it is, the creature knows no bounds and sees
   neither friend nor foe, only meat.
   The Beast must be placed within 6” of a side of the board
   that is not a Deployment Zone and at least 6” away from
   a Deployment Zone. The players roll-off to determine
   on which side of the board the creature will appear. The
   winning player chooses the board side and the losing
   player places the creature where they deem fit, according
   to the parameters above.
   Note that the Beast cannot be initially placed anywhere
   within 12” of a warband model.
   At the end of each of a model’s Activation, the player
   must roll 1D6. On a roll of 1-4, the Beast is Activated
   subsequently, before the opponent activates one of their
   own models. The same player then acts out the Beast’s
   actions, as described in its profile. If by the end of the
   turn the Beast hasn’t been activated, it is before the start
   of the next turn. The Beast can only be Activated once
   per turn. Below is the Beast’s profile and special rules:
   Name: Beast | Movement: 8”/Infantry
   Ranged: N/A | Melee: +2 Dice
   Armour: 0 | Base: 120 x 80mm
   Keywords: FEAR, TOUGH
   Rules: The Beast model can be up to 60mm tall, placed
   on a base of 120 x 80mm. It is armed only with its
   vicious Claws and devastating Bite. These are natural
   153
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   parts of the creature itself and cannot be removed or lost
   in any way.
   The Beast will seek out the nearest model with the most
   BLOOD MARKERS, driven by its bloodthirsty frenzy.
   The Beast will Charge the model through the fastest
   route and will Climb, Jump Over Gaps, Between Ledges
   of Unequal Heights and Down (as long as the height
   won’t cause an injury to it) to get at a warband model.
   However, note that it will not move through Dangerous
   terrain if it can be avoided. The Beast does not need to
   have line of sight of a model to Charge it. If the beast
   cannot Charge a model, it will just Move toward the
   nearest one.
   When the Beast reaches a model, it will make one
   attack ACTION with each of its Claws and one attack
   ACTION with its Bite, all in Melee Combat (so it can
   make three attacks per Activation). If the Beast Charges
   more than one model, it will split its attacks amongst the
   opponents.
   Equipment
   ; Bite: The Beast treats its Bite as a melee weapon
   that grants a +1 DICE bonus to hit (for a total of
   +3D). Additionally, the attack ignores any armour
   worn by the target and has a +1 DICE bonus to
   injure. The Bite does not take any hands to wield.
   ; Claws: The Beast treats its Claws as two onehanded melee weapons with the Keywords RISKY.
   The Claws have a +1 DICE bonus to injure. Because
   the Claws are wielded alongside the Bite, they are
   both treated as Off-Hand Weapons and suffer
   penalties accordingly.
   Abilities
   ; Resilient: The Beast is a massive creature with
   unnatural vitality and is subject to the rules for
   TOUGH creatures. Additionally, its hide is rough
   and thick, acting like natural armour. Attacks made
   against the Beast are made with -1 DICE.
   ; Unrelenting: The Beast may take its Dash and
   any of its Jump ACTIONS with +2 DICE.
   ; Terrifying: The Beast is a horrid abomination
   whose infamous repute has spread across many
   villages and towns caught in the tides of war. Trench
   tales speak of the carnage and desolation it leaves on
   its path, causing unfathomable FEAR.
5. Rat Frenzy
   Rats have infested the trenches ever since the start of
   the war. Troops wake up to the skittering of their little
   paws, the grinding of their teeth gnawing and tearing
   at the dead, and even swarming upon the living when
   the rotten flesh runs low and dry from the bones of the
   fallen. The sounds of gunfight, the bombs detonating
   upon the ground, the spreading of smoke and ash, and
   the disturbance of the troops storming the shore has
   stirred the rats’ nest and the pests now scurry out of
   their holes in a ravenous frenzy, feeding on anything that
   stands in their way.
   Rules: Use two templates of 80mm to represent the
   Swarms of Rats. Use two Swarm of Rats’ models if you
   have them. The players roll-off to place each Swarm
   of Rats on the board. The Swarms must be placed
   within 8” of any piece of terrain, including terrain
   within Deployment Zones, but cannot be placed over
   Impassable terrain or surrounded by it, and cannot
   be placed directly on top of another model or in base
   contact with them. The Swarms must be placed at least
   3” away from any warband model.
   The Swarms are considered Dangerous Terrain, with
   +1 DICE to injure. A model can Move through,
   start its Move or end its movement on a Swarm. If a
   model comes into base contact with a Swarm, they’re
   considered to be standing on Dangerous Terrain.
   If a model armed with a weapon, or that has an ability
   with the Keyword FIRE or BLAST, and that is not
   knocked Down, comes into base contact with a Swarm,
   it can attempt a RISKY ACTION to disperse the Swarm
   without triggering the Dangerous terrain effect.
   If successful, remove the Swarm from the game board
   and the Activation of the model is over regardless of any
   remaining ACTIONS the model might have.
   Each Swarm moves 2D6” at the start of each combat
   turn, before the Activation of any model. They will
   always move toward the nearest model that is knocked
   Down or toward the nearest model that is not engaged
   in melee combat and that is at least 6” away from any
   other model. The Swarms cannot move toward a model
   that causes FEAR. The Swarm must have line of sight to
   the model that is either knocked Down or singled out in
   order to move toward them. If neither condition is met,
   the Swarm does not move on that turn.
   The Swarms cannot be engaged in any form of combat.
   The Swarms will stay for D3 turns after which the rats
   will scurry back to their holes and disappear.
6. Long Lost Stash
   The constant bombardment over the shore uncovers
   long lost stashes, containing several weapons and items,
   the spoils of war. Each player places one Objective
   Marker to represent these stashes to a total of two, each
   at least 8” away from any Deployment Zone, at least
   8” away from each other and at least 6” away from any
   model. The stashes cannot be placed on impassable
   terrain or surrounded by it.
   154
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   A model that comes into base contact with the stash
   claims it. The model’s owner rolls 1D6 for a chance to
   get one of the following items:
   1: A Trench Shield
   2: A Standard Armour
   3: Grenades
   4: A Medi-kit
   5: Armour Piercing Bullets (the model that claimed
   the stash may, in this case only, use this item during
   this battle to have its respective effect until the end
   of the game)
   6: A Grenade Launcher.
   The model that claims the stash may immediately equip
   the item they have looted for the duration of this game.
   Victory Conditions
   If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their
   Morale test, the game ends and the opposing warband
   wins. Otherwise, keep a running tally of Victory Points
   for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as follows:
   ; The players score five VPs for each Objective
   Building that they have taken control of. The
   Attacker scores two VPs for each Objective Building
   they have destroyed.
   ; The players control an Objective Building if the
   total number of models from their warband (that are
   wholly within that building) is higher than the total
   number of enemy models within 1” of the Objective
   Building. A model is considered wholly within
   a building if it is entirely within the edges of the
   building’s footprint, as agreed by the players.
   ; The Attacker destroys an Objective Building if
   at least one of their ELITE models that is wholly
   within the building plants an explosive charge.
   The model can plant the explosive charge with an
   Action (no roll required) but upon doing so, the
   Activation of the model ends. In any following
   turn, if the ELITE model is activated and moves at
   least 1” outside the building’s footprint (previously
   accorded by the players), the Objective Building is
   immediately destroyed and any other model (friend
   or foe) that is still wholly within the building must
   immediately roll on the Injury Chart, ignoring
   armour. If the ELITE model is taken Out of Action
   before its next Activation, the explosive charge does
   not go off.
   If you are playing a Campaign, the Winner gains 5
   Victory Points.
   Calculate VPs at the end of the game for both players
   and add them together. The player with the higher
   number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is a draw.
   However, the following conditions can alter the tides
   of battle, granting the win regardless of the VPs a player
   may have accumulated:
   ; If the Attacker takes control of the Main
   Structure Objective Building for two full
   consecutive turns, they win the game regardless of
   the VPs the Defender may have.
   ; If the Defender takes all of the Attacker’s ELITE
   models Out of Action, they win the game regardless
   of the VPs the Attacker may have.
   If either of these two victory conditions are met at any
   point during the game, it is considered a decisive win for
   the respective player and the game immediately ends
   Glorious Deeds
   Players score one Glory Point for every model that
   completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Glory
   Points for these can only be gained once – whichever
   player completes them first gets the Glory Points!
   ; The Shore is Ours: As the Attacker, win the
   game by taking control of the Main Structure
   Objective Building for two full consecutive turns.
   Your last activated model to have entered the Main
   Structure (and that was not taken Out of Action)
   gains the Glory Point.
   ; The Head of the Snake: As the Defender, take
   half of the Attacker’s ELITE models Out of Action
   (rounded down) with the same model.
   ; Battlefield Legend: Take at least two enemy
   models Out of Action with the same model during
   the battle with any ACTIONS the model has,
   without suffering any BLOOD MARKERS. If the
   model suffers a BLOOD MARKER but reduces it
   back to zero, the count resets and the model is now
   eligible to score this deed again if they meet the
   necessary requirements stated above.
   ; Blood Cloud: Take at least three enemy models
   Out of Action with one of your models using a
   weapon with the Keyword BLAST.
   ; Cold Blooded Killer: Use 2+ BLOOD
   MARKERS on a Melee Attack of one of your models
   to take an enemy ELITE model Out of Action in a
   single Activation.
   ; Ghost of Shores: Take an enemy ELITE model
   Out of Action with one of your models with the
   Keywords INFILTRATOR or SKIRMISHER.
   155
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   If agreed by the players prior to starting the game, you
   may replace one of the Glory Deeds above for one of the
   following options:
   ; Rat Catcher: Disperse a Swarm of Rats that has
   taken another model Out of Action, with a model
   armed with a weapon with the Keyword FIRE.
   ; Bloody Beast: Take the Beast Out of Action
   with a model that has at least 2+ BLOOD MARKERS
   at the start of its Activation.

   Scenario 9:
   Dragon Hunt
   157
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   Overview
   Reports from the front lines tell of a massive entity
   tearing through the afflicted, plague-ridden villages
   surrounding No Man’s Land. Some claim it to be a
   newborn Larval Beast, a Possessed Tank, others an
   Angelic creature gone rogue and some even say it is an
   actual Dragon. The descriptions vary, but all agree on its
   immense size and the trail of destruction and bloodshed
   it leaves behind. Showing no allegiance, the creature has
   trampled warbands and strongholds alike, spreading
   chaos indiscriminately. Hunting down “The Dragon,” as
   it has been named in the scattered reports, has become a
   top priority. The warband that claims its head will secure
   prestige and glory across the theatre of war.
   Forces
   Both sides use their entire forces.
   The Battlefield
   The game is played on a standard-size battlefield (we
   suggest 4’ x 4’).
   Place a model on a base of at least 120mm to represent
   the Dragon at the centre of the table, as indicated on the
   map by the Objective Marker.
   Each player then places three models each (that are
   on 25mm bases) where they see fit. These represent
   peasants. Note that the peasants must be placed at least
   6” away from another model, at least 8” away from the
   Dragon, at least 6” away from a player’s deployment
   zone and cannot be placed on – or be surrounded by –
   Impassable Terrain.
   Fill the rest of the battlefield with terrain in the usual
   way, using models such as barricades, ruined buildings,
   trees, sandbags etc.
   Infiltrators
   Infiltrators can be used in this scenario but they cannot
   be placed within 8” of the Dragon model.
   Deployment
   The players roll-off. The loser of the roll-off chooses
   which deployment zone will be theirs. The other
   deployment zone will be their opponent’s.
   The players then take it in turns to deploy one model at
   a time, starting with the player who has more models in
   their warband (roll-off if both have the same number of
   models).
   Models must be set up wholly within their own
   deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
   up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
   Once the players have set up their models, deployment
   ends and the battle begins.
   Battle Length
   At the end of the fourth turn, a player rolls 1D6. On a
   roll of 1-2, the battle ends. Otherwise, the game lasts for
   five turns.
   The Dragon
   The Dragon is activated once per turn. At the end of
   each of a player’ model Activation, the player must
   roll a 1D6. On a roll of 5-6, the Dragon is Activated
   subsequently, before the opponent activates one of their
   own models. The same player then acts out the Dragon’s
   actions, as described in its profile. If by the end of the
   turn the Dragon hasn’t been activated, it is before the
   start of the next turn. Below is the Dragon’s profile and
   special rules:
   Name: The Dragon | Movement: 10”/Infantry
   Ranged: +3 Dice | Melee: +3 Dice
   Armour: -3 | Base: 120mm+
   Keywords: FEAR
   Rules: The Dragon’s model must be placed on a base
   of at least 120mm and can go up to a 300mm base. You
   can use a Larval Beast to proxy the model, or a Possessed
   Tank or even an actual Dragon model. The larger the
   model is the better – however, the less Movement it also
   has, according to the following metrics:
   ; On a 120mm to 200mm base = Movement: 10”
   ; On a 210mm to 250mm base = Movement: 9”
   ; On a 260mm to 300mm base = Movement: 8”.
   The Dragon is considered both an enemy model and
   as Difficult Terrain. When in base contact with it, a
   warband model can Climb the Dragon, Move through
   it, beneath it, on it and start or end its movement
   beneath it or on it. Ideally, the Dragon’s model should
   be big enough to allow for two models on a 60mm base
   to stand on top of it (or up to four models on a 25mm
   base). A model that is on top of the Dragon rolls with
   158
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   +1 DICE to hit it and +1 DICE to injure it. However,
   note that all ACTIONS taken by a model on top of
   the Dragon are considered as RISKY. Additionally,
   when the Dragon uses its Move, any model on top of
   it must immediately succeed at a RISKY ACTION. On
   a fail, the model is forcibly moved 2” in a direction of
   the opponent’s choice and is knocked Down. If this
   movement forces the model to fall from the Dragon, the
   model’s owner must also roll on the Injury Chart, as per
   the rules of Falling.
   When Activated, the Dragon will Move towards the
   nearest Peasant model via the fastest route possible.
   The Dragon cannot Charge as usual. Instead, if its
   movement takes it into contact with a model it counts
   as charging and engages that model in melee combat,
   if that is the Dragon’s intended target. When moving
   toward a targeted model, if the Dragon comes into base
   contact with another model that it is not targeting, it
   does not engage in melee combat with it, even if the
   model intends to engage it. Instead, the Dragon will run
   right over them. Any model moved over by the Dragon
   suffers an injury. The player controlling the Dragon
   immediately rolls on the Injury Chart with +1 DICE to
   injure, for any models trampled by the Dragon.
   When attacked by a warband model, the Dragon will
   seek out the last warband model that attacked it on
   its next Activation. The Dragon will Move toward
   the model via the fastest route possible (even through
   certain impassable terrain pieces, if possible. See below).
   The Dragon ignores movement penalties and effects
   caused by Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain. If
   the last model that attacked the Dragon is on top of it,
   or if the Dragon cannot reach the model that attacked it
   in one Activation, on its next Activation it will shift its
   focus to either move toward the nearest Peasant model,
   the last model that attacked it or to leave the area. If the
   Dragon attacks a targeted model at the start of its turn,
   it will then use its Movement to either move toward the
   nearest Peasant model or to leave the area.
   Note that the Dragon does not need to have line of sight
   to a model to Move toward it.
   If there are no more Peasant models present on the
   table before the end of the game, having either escaped
   the area (see the Peasant section) or been taken Out of
   Action, the Dragon will shift its focus to leave the area
   to continue its rampage elsewhere, using its Movement
   when Activated to reach the nearest edge of the table.
   If the Dragon comes into base contact with any of
   the table’s edges, it successfully leaves the area. See the
   Victory Conditions section. Note that the Dragon
   cannot Dash.
   The Dragon’s limbs function as its weapons. It is armed
   with its Stomp, its Tail Swipe and its Fire Breath. These
   are parts of the creature itself and cannot be removed
   or lost in any way. When the Dragon comes into base
   contact with a model that it has targeted, it will make
   two attack ACTIONS with its Stomp in Melee Combat
   (so it can make two attacks per Activation with this
   weapon).
   If the Dragon engages in Melee combat with multiple
   models, it will make one attack ACTION against each
   model, with its Tail Swipe instead (see below). However,
   after the Dragon is knocked Down twice, as per its
   Undying special rule (see below), it loses its tail, meaning
   that it cannot use its Tail Swipe attack any longer.
   If the Dragon’s movement does not get it into Melee
   range of a model, or if the model moves away from
   its Melee range but remains within range to use its
   Fire Breath, it attacks once with it instead in Ranged
   Combat.
   Equipment
   ; Stomp: The Dragon treats its Stomp as a melee
   weapon that grants a +1 DICE bonus to hit (for
   total of +4 DICE). Additionally, the attack ignores
   any armour worn by the target and has a +1 DICE
   bonus to injure. The Stomp takes one “hand” to
   wield.
   ; Fire Breath: The Dragon treats its Fire Breath as
   a ranged weapon with 10” range. It hits up to two
   models within range automatically with the Attack
   ACTION as long as they are within 6” of each other.
   This attack has the Keyword FIRE, so it causes an
   additional +1 BLOOD MARKER on enemies it hits,
   even if no other damage is caused. Additionally, the
   attack ignores any armour worn by the target. The
   Fire Breath does not take any hands to wield.
   ; Tail Swipe: The Dragon treats its Tail Swipe as a
   melee weapon. This weapon has the same rules as a
   two-handed hammer but its huge reach means that
   the Dragon may make one Melee Attack ACTION
   against each enemy model it is fighting in Melee.
   Abilities
   ; Undying: The Dragon is an extremely resilient
   opponent. If a model’s attack would take the Dragon
   Out of Action, it is knocked Down instead. Every
   time the Dragon is knocked Down this way, any
   BLOOD MARKERS it may have are removed. Use a
   dice to match the corresponding number of times
   the Dragon has been knocked Down. The Dragon
   must then be knocked Down in this way two more
   times (for a total of three) before it can be taken Out
   of Action. However, note that on its last “life”, the
   Dragon can only be taken Out of Action then when
   it accumulates six BLOOD MARKERS. These BLOOD
   MARKERS can then be used to cause a Blood Bath or
   to add +DICE to kill the Dragon.
   ; Resistant: At the start of each of its Activations,
   159
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   the Dragon can remove one BLOOD MARKER from
   itself, if it has any. Additionally, attacks with the
   Keyword GAS, FIRE or SHRAPNEL suffer a -1
   DICE penalty to injure the Dragon.
   ; Siege Weapon: The Dragon’s massive size allows
   it to destroy buildings and other pieces of structures
   that are up to half of its base size. If what would
   normally be considered as an impassable terrain
   piece, that is in the Dragon’s path and corresponds
   to the metrics above, when the Dragon moves it
   will pass over it, crumbling the structure completely.
   Remove the piece from the board – the area where
   it was becomes Difficult Terrain the same size as the
   building was. Additionally, any model that is wholly
   within the building’s footprint (previously accorded
   by the players) when it crumbles must immediately
   roll on the Injury Chart, ignoring armour.
   ; Terrifying: The Dragon instils horror in the
   minds of those who witness it, causing unfathomable
   FEAR.
   The Peasants
   The villages surrounding the frontlines have been
   tainted by all sorts of maladies and misfortune. The war
   has taken its toll on the peasantry, many of which are
   contaminated with never seen before afflictions. Hence
   the main reason why they have not been evacuated
   from the battlefield. However, their taint has attracted
   the attention of the Dragon. Rescuing them is not an
   option. They pose a great risk to the troops.
   So, putting an end to their miserable lives is the only
   right thing to do and the order that every warband sent
   to claim the Dragon’s head has been given to by their
   higher ups.
   All Peasants are deployed at the start of the game (see the
   Battlefield section). Each Peasant is activated once per
   turn. At the end of each of a player’ model Activation,
   the same player also Activates a Peasant model anywhere
   on the table that hasn’t been Activated yet. The player
   then acts out the Peasant’s actions, as described in its
   profile. The players alternate between Activating the
   Peasants until all have been Activated in that turn. Below
   is the Peasant’s profile and special rules:
   Name: Peasant | Movement: 5”/Infantry
   Ranged: N/A | Melee: N/A
   Armour: 0 | Base: 25mm
   Rules: The Peasant has no attacks, equipment or
   abilities. They can only Move, as per their normal
   Movement, and cannot Dash. When Activated, a
   Peasant will always try to move as far away as possible
   from the Dragon, toward one of the table’s edges. In this
   path, they should also try to keep as much distance as
   possible from any warband model. However, note that
   the Peasant will not Move into Dangerous Terrain and
   will also try to avoid Difficult Terrain, if possible.
   If a Peasant comes into base contact with any of the
   table’s edges, it successfully leaves the area. Remove the
   corresponding Peasant model from the board.
   The afflicted peasantry’s feeble nature makes them
   vulnerable in any confrontation. Attacks made against a
   Peasant are made with +2 DICE to Hit and +2 DICE
   to injure.

   Victory Conditions
   If one warband is wiped out completely or loses their
   Morale test, the game ends and the opposing warband
   wins. Otherwise, keep a running tally of Victory Points
   for both sides. The players accumulate VPs as follows:
   ; A player scores four VPs for each time they
   knock Down the Dragon with one of their warband
   models.
   ; A player scores six VPs for taking the Dragon
   Out of Action with one of their warband models.
   ; A player scores two VPs for each Peasant taken
   Out of Action by one of their warband models. If a
   Peasant model escapes the area, neither player gains
   the VPs for that model.
   Calculate VPs at the end of the game for both players
   and add them together. The player with the higher
   number of VPs wins, otherwise the game is a draw.
   However, the following condition can bring the game to
   an immediate end, regardless of the VPs the players may
   have accumulated:
   ; If the Dragon successfully leaves the battlefield,
   neither of the players win the game, regardless of
   the VPs they may have accumulated up until this
   point. Take into account only the Glorious Deeds
   performed, if any, and award no VPs.
   Glorious Deeds
   Players score one Glory Point for every model that
   completes any of the following Glorious Deeds. Glory
   Points for these can only be gained once – whichever
   player completes them first gets the Glory Points!
   ; Dragon Slayer: Take the Dragon Out of Action
   with one of your models (that is on top of it) using
   a melee weapon. This Deed is worth two Glory
   Points.
   ; Genocidal: Take at least three Peasants Out of
   Action with the same model.
   ; Opportunist: Use a Peasant during its Activation
   to lure the Dragon into moving over an enemy
   model. Your model whose turn was prior to the
   Peasant’s gains the Glory Point.
   ; Off My Back: Make an enemy model that is on
   top of the Dragon fall due to your action (shooting,
   melee, Supernatural Power etc).
   ; Fire with Fire: Inflict 2+ BLOOD MARKERS on
   the Dragon with the same model, using a weapon
   with either the Keyword FIRE, GAS or SHRAPNEL.

   Terrain
   Set up terrain as explained in the terrain section of the
   book. It is important for any battlefield to have enough
   terrain to block Line of Sight at regular intervals so that
   the game does not turn into a battle where only longrange weapons matter. Both players should set up an
   equal number of terrain pieces.
   Game Length
   At the end of the fifth turn of the game, one of the
   players rolls a D6. If the result is 4 or more, the game
   ends. If the game continues, the game ends at the end of
   the sixth turn.
   Roll for Scenario Type
   After terrain has been placed, either player rolls a D6
   and consults the chart below to determine the victory
   conditions for the game. Note that if you are playing the
   campaign, the winner always gains 5 Victory Points if
   otherwise the result would indicate less.

   Generator
   These rules can be used to generate either one-off or
   Campaign scenarios on the fly. To Generate a Scenario,
   follow these steps:
1. One player rolls for Scenario type on the chart
   below.
2. One player rolls for Deployment type on the
   chart below.
3. Both players roll for Glorious Deeds on the charts
   below.
4. Players set up Terrain according to the
   instructions.
5. Players deploy their troops according to
   instructions.
6. Determine the Length of the Game as detailed
   below.
   Setting Up
   Unless the scenario instructs otherwise, the players take
   it in turns to deploy one model at a time, starting with
   the player who has more models in their warband (rolloff if both have the same number of models).
   Models must be set up wholly within their own
   deployment zone. If a player runs out of models to set
   up, the other player sets up all their models afterwards.
   Once the players have set up their models, deployment
   ends and the battle begins.
   When a model that is not set up on the playing area
   moves onto the table, measure the move from its entry
   point as determined in the scenario.

   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   Scenario Objective 1:
   Attritional Battle
   At the end of the game, each player totals up the ducat
   value of their enemy models that they have taken Out
   of Action and divides the number by 100, rounding any
   fractions up to find the number of Victory Points each
   player has scored. Troops bought with Glory Points are
   worth 30 ducats per Glory Point for this calculation. The
   highest scoring player wins. You gain +1 Victory Point
   for each enemy you kill on the opposing half of the table
   from your own.
   Scenario Objective 2:
   Take and Hold
   Each player rolls D3+1 and takes that many 1” radius
   Objective markers. The player with the most objective
   markers (or the winner of a roll-off, if both players have
   the same number of markers) begins by placing one of
   their Objective markers on the playing surface. Then
   the opponent does the same and they keep alternating
   until both players have placed all of their Objective
   markers. Objective markers can be placed anywhere on
   the playing surface outside Impassable Terrain, and more
   than 8” away from another marker, table edge or any
   Deployment Zone. If it becomes impossible to place any
   more markers, the remaining markers are discarded.
   To hold an objective, a player must have a model within
   3” of the marker and there must be no enemy models
   at all within 3” of the same marker. If either of these
   conditions is not met, that objective is not held by any
   player.
   After the game ends, the players determine how many
   objectives they control. The player with the most
   objective markers wins. If they hold the same number of
   objectives, the game is a draw.
   Scenario Objective 3:
   Sabotage
   Each player places objectives, as described for Mission
2. Then the players roll-off and the winner decides to be
   the attacker or defender. During the game, the attacker
   can destroy the objectives by planting mines/demolition
   charges or other explosives on them.
   To plant an explosive charge on an objective, any
   attacking model must first move into base contact with
   the objective marker and then use any melee attack
   ACTION they have on the objective – this automatically
   plants the charges and the Activation of the model
   ends. In any following turn, if the attacking model
   is activated and moves away from the marker, the
   objective is automatically destroyed and any other model
   (friends and foes) that is still in base contact with the
   objective must immediately roll on the Injury Chart
   while ignoring armour. If the model moves away from
   the marker or is taken Out of Action before its next
   Activation, the explosive charge does not go off.
   After the game ends, if the attacker has destroyed more
   objectives than their opponent, the Attacker wins. If less,
   then the Attacker loses. If both players have destroyed
   exactly the same number of the objectives, the game is a
   draw.
   Infiltrators must be deployed as normal troops.
   Scenario Objective 4:
   Over the Top
   Both players place four 8”+ long trench sections in their
   own deployment zone, at least 3” away from the nearest
   other trench. At the end of the battle, players score 1
   Victory Point for each of their own trenches they hold
   where there are no enemy models in the same trench
   section. They gain 1 Victory Point for each enemy trench
   they have that has at least one of their own models and 2
   VPs if there are no enemy models in the trench.
   If you roll a Chance Encounter as a Deployment type,
   roll again until you get a different one.
   Scenario Objective 5:
   Breakthrough
   After rolling for setup type, and just before starting the
   Setup Warbands step, the players roll off and the winner
   picks any of the four table edges for their opponent to
   escape from. Then the opponent does the same, but
   they cannot pick the same table edge picked by the first
   player.
   Any model that moves into contact with the ‘extraction
   point,’ which is the point in the exact centre of the
   chosen table edge, is removed and counts as escaped. If
   enemy models are placed to block the extraction point,
   models can escape as near as possible to the extraction
   point, on either side of the blocking models.
   At the end of the game, each player totals up the
   164
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
   ducat value of their own models that have escaped the
   battlefield and divides the number by 100, rounding any
   fractions up to find the number of Victory Points each
   player has scored. Troops bought with Glory Points are
   worth 30 ducats per Glory Point for this calculation. The
   highest scoring player wins.
   Scenario Objective 6:
   Retrieve
   Move the area of dense terrain (of at least 6” x 6” and
   that is closest to the centre of the table) so that it is in the
   centre of the table, and then place an objective marker
   on it, exactly in the centre of the table. This marker
   represents a small object, like relic or an artefact, lost
   experimental weapon etc.
   During the game, any model that ends its move in
   contact with the marker picks it up. That model is now
   carrying the object and will carry it until it leaves the
   table or is destroyed. As long as it is carrying the object,
   the model cannot Attack and cannot Dash and no other
   method of movement (teleportation, Puppet Master
   etc.) can be used to move the model due the mystical
   effect of the relic! At the end of its activation, the model
   can pass the object to any friendly model within 1”
   range, as long as neither model is in melee combat with
   an enemy. The model receiving the object is considered
   to have ended their Activation this turn, if it has not
   have done so yet.
   If the model carrying the object is taken Out of Action
   the object is immediately thrown D6” in a direction
   indicated by the opposing player, though never out of
   the battlefield. Stop if the object moves into contact with
   Impenetrable Terrain just outside it. If it lands on top
   of a model, the model immediately picks it up, except if
   there is also an enemy model in melee combat with it, in
   which case it is thrown again.
   If the model carrying the object moves into contact with
   any table edge, it has escaped with the object and the
   player immediately wins the game.
   If the game ends while a model is carrying the object,
   the players roll off with D6 one last time. If the player
   controlling the model carrying the objective wins the
   roll-off, they win the game. In any other case, the game
   is a draw.
   Infiltrators must be deployed as normal troops.
   Roll for Deployment Type
   The player that did not roll for Missions rolls a D6 and
   consults the chart below to determine how the warbands
   deploy for the game.
1. Chance Encounter
   The players roll-off and the winner chooses which long
   table side belongs to them (or any edge if you are playing
   on a square area). The opponent gets the opposite
   table edge (see diagram). Models are not set up on
   the table at the start of the game. Instead, on the first
   turn of the game, half of the warband (selected by each
   player) enters the battlefield. When one of the models
   is activated, it starts its move onto the table from any
   point along the player’s table edge, though it cannot be
   deployed directly into melee combat. In turn two, the
   rest of the warband is deployed exactly the same way.
   The scenario with Chance Encounter deployment lasts
   for a minimum of six turns.
   Deployment Type Chart (roll a D6)
   1 CHANCE ENCOUNTER
   2 STANDARD DEPLOYMENT
   3 FLANK ATTACK
   4 LONG-DISTANCE BATTLE
   5 TUNNELS
   6 FOG OF WAR
   165
   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
2. Standard Deployment
   The players roll-off and the winner chooses which table
   edge belongs to them. The opponent gets the opposite
   table edge.
3. Flank Attack
   Use the Flank Attack Deployment Map below. The
   winner of the roll-off then places one model anywhere
   within their Deployment Zone (see diagram). The
   opponent does the same. Then the first player places
   another model and the two keep alternating until all
   models have been set up.
4. Long-distance Battle
   The players roll-off and the winner chooses which corner
   of the table belongs to them. The opponent gets the
   opposite corner. The winner of the roll-off then places
   one model anywhere within 12” of their table corner
   (see diagram). The opponent does the same. Then the
   first player places another model and the two keep
   alternating until all models have been set up. Battles with
   this deployment last a minimum of six Turns.
5. Tunnels
   The players roll-off and the winner places a 1” Tunnel
   Marker anywhere that is more than 6” from the table’s
   middle line (see diagram), though not on Impassable
   Terrain. Their opponent does the same on the opposite
   side of the table’s middle line.
   Not all models are set up on the table at the start of the
   game. Players must leave half of their models in reserve
   (rounding down). On the first turn of the game, the
   remaining models enter the battle through tunnels
   – when one of these models is Activated, it is placed
   anywhere within 6” of its Tunnel Marker, though not in
   melee combat. Models that enter the battlefield this way
   cannot Dash in the first turn of the game.
   Infiltrators are deployed as normal troops in this
   deployment type.

   TRENCH CRUSADE PLAYTEST RULES
6. Fog of War
   The players roll-off and the winner chooses which table
   side belongs to them. Their opponent gets the opposite
   table edge (see diagram) and both deploy normally.
   Not all models are set up on the table at the start of the
   game. Players must leave half of their models in reserve
   (rounding down).
   On the first turn of the game, the remaining models
   enter the battle at random locations – when one of these
   models is Activated, the player rolls a D6 and consults
   the Fog of War Chart below. The chart details from
   which table edge the model enters. Models entering the
   battle cannot be placed directly into melee combat.
   Fog of War Chart
   Roll one D6 and consult the following chart:
1. Your opponent chooses one of the results below.
2. Enter from the centre of the North edge.
3. Enter from the centre of the East edge.
4. Enter from the centre of the South edge.
5. Enter from the centre of the West edge.
6. You choose one of the results above.
   Glorious Deeds
   To determine the Glorious Deeds for the scenario, each
   player rolls two D6, one after the other. If a player rolls
   the same result on both dice, roll one of the dice again
   until it shows a different result. Match each player’s
   results to their table below.
   Finally, every scenario shares a fifth Glorious Deed:
   “Victorious: Win the Battle.” Completing any of these
   Glorious Deeds earns the player 1 Glory Point. Once
   a Glorious Deed is completed by a player, it cannot be
   completed again by either player.
