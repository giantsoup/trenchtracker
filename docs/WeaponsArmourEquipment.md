This document details the various weapons, armour, and other equipment available to warbands in Trench Crusade.

---

## **Ranged Weapons**

### Pistol/revolver

> Pistols come in a staggering variety, ranging from revolvers to semi-automatic pistols. Heretic forges produce their
> own, often highly elaborate sidearms. They see extensive use in close-quarter combat.

| Type     | Range     | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| 1-handed | 12”/Melee | -         | -        |

**Rules:** A model armed with a pistol can use it in melee as well as ranged combat (using Ranged Characteristic),
including as an off-hand weapon to execute an additional melee attack.

### Automatic Pistol

> Automatic pistols are symbols of prestige owing to their rarity and cost. They are excellent weapons when storming
> trenches or fighting in hand-to-hand combat. They boast a high rate of fire, though they can be hard to control even for
> the best sharpshooters since they usually lack a stock.

| Type     | Range     | Modifiers                | Keywords |
|:---------|:----------|:-------------------------|:---------|
| 1-handed | 12”/Melee | -1D to injury, 2 attacks | ASSAULT  |

**Rules:** A model armed with an automatic pistol can use it in melee as well as ranged combat (using Ranged
Characteristic), including as an off-hand weapon to execute an additional melee attack. You can make two Attack ACTIONS
with the automatic pistol instead of one if used as a ranged weapon. They can be against the same target or two
different ones.

### Bolt Action Rifle

> The workhorse of the Great War. Sturdy, highly reliable and reasonably accurate, it is no surprise that most of the
> infantry of the Great War carry this battlefield classic.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 24”   | -         | -        |

### Semi-Automatic Rifle

> Semi-automatic rifles are said to be an invention of Marbas, the Devil who holds great wisdom and knowledge in
> mechanical arts. They are excellent both at long range and in assault, combining accuracy and high rate of fire, though
> they are prone to jamming.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 24”   | -         | ASSAULT  |

### Automatic Rifle

> A marvel of modern engineering, only a few prototypes exist. It has a high rate of fire and can be quickly re-loaded.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 24”   | 2 attacks | ASSAULT  |

**Rules:** A model armed with an Automatic Rifle can make two attack ACTIONS instead of one. Both attacks must be
against the same target.

### Jezzail

> These long arms are by far the most common weapons carried by the soldiers of the Sultanate of the Great Iron Wall.
> Their barrels are smoothbore which limits their accurate range, but this is more than made up by the fact that this
> allows them to be loaded with different types of Alchemical ammunition made by the Jabirean Alchemists.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 18”   | -         | -        |

### Shotgun

> Short-barrelled pump action shotgun loaded with six rounds containing antimony hardened 00 buckshot, the combat
> shotgun is ideal for short-range engagements, clearing trenches and taking out lightly-armoured infantry. Often
> featuring stocks made of walnut or other rare wood, it is a custom of the troops to decorate these arms with carvings
> and inscriptions.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 12”   | +1D Hit   | -        |

**Rules:** Owing to its high accuracy, add +1 DICE to all rolls to hit and ignore the penalty to hit rolls when
attacking at long range. However, injuries are rolled with -1 DICE at long range due to the low penetration power.

### Automatic Shotgun

> This shotgun is equipped with an auto-loader, a recent invention by the Prussian engineering corps of Königsberg. It
> is ideal for close quarter combat thanks to its high rate of power and accuracy. The technology has not been perfected,
> however, and sometimes leads to misfeeds and jams.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 12”   | +1D Hit   | ASSAULT  |

**Rules:** Owing to its high accuracy, add +1 DICE to all rolls to hit and ignore the penalty to hit rolls when
attacking at long range. However, injuries are rolled with -1 DICE at long range due to the low penetration power.

### Heavy Shotgun

> Mostly used by Mechanized Heavy Infantry, this massive 8 bore shotgun is used to take down extremely powerful and
> large opponents at short range. It is known as a “Wolf-Killer” in New Antioch as it is the weapon favoured by the
> soldiery of the Duke to take down the Heretic War Wolf assault beasts. Heavy Shotguns use tungsten-orichalcum alloy shot
> which explains their enormous stopping power at short ranges.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers                                      | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 12”   | +1D to Attacks, +2D to injuries at Short Range | HEAVY    |

**Rules:** This weapon rolls attacks with +1 DICE and rolls injuries at Short Range with +2 DICE.

### Submachine Gun (SMG)

> The submachine gun (or SMG) is a fully automatic firearm, trading lower penetration power and range for a much higher
> rate of fire. Ideal for short-range engagements, it is much sought-after by warbands despite its scarcity and high cost.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 16”   | 2 Attacks | ASSAULT  |

**Rules:** Can make two attack ACTIONS instead of one. These can be against a single target or two separate ones.

### Musket

> A primitive weapon from a bygone age, the musket is a smooth bore long rifle that shoots lead balls. It still sees
> widespread use due to its simple construction and low price.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers  | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:-----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 18”   | -1D Injury | -        |

**Rules:** Due to its low power, add -1 DICE for all Injury Chart rolls with the musket.

### Silenced Pistol

> A sophisticated sidearm made of Orichalcum or other holy metals, or from Infernal iron taken from the very prisons of
> Hell to muffle the wails of the damned. It is virtually silent and is excellent for ambushes or for shooting from behind
> cover.

| Type     | Range     | Modifiers           | Keywords |
|:---------|:----------|:--------------------|:---------|
| 1-handed | 12”/Melee | +1D to Hit in Cover | ASSAULT  |

**Rules:** A model armed with a silenced pistol can use it in melee as well as ranged combat (using Ranged
Characteristic), including as an off-hand weapon to execute an additional melee attack. Add +1 DICE to hit rolls if shot
from behind any terrain obstacles.

### Sniper Rifle

> A sniper rifle is a high-precision, long-range rifle, widely used in the trenches to pick off high value targets such
> as officers, sappers and artillery crews. Expensive and rare, they are commonly given to the best marksmen and
> sharpshooters of the warband.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers  | Keywords        |
|:---------|:------|:-----------|:----------------|
| 2-handed | 48”   | +1D to Hit | RISKY, CRITICAL |

**Rules:** This weapon rolls attacks with +1 DICE. On a Critical attack roll, this weapon ignores armour. If this model
is equipped with a Scope, this weapon ignores the penalty for Long Range.

### Grenade Launcher

> Modifications of great siege rifles designed to lob grenades over long distances.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers    | Keywords                  |
|:---------|:------|:-------------|:--------------------------|
| 2-handed | 36”   | Ignore Cover | SHRAPNEL, HEAVY, BLAST 3” |

**Rules:** Ignores all penalties for cover. This weapon has a BLAST radius of 3” – all models within this range are hit.

### Anti-Materiel Rifle

> Enormous long rifles designed to take out heavily armoured targets, vehicles and strongpoints. With the powerful
> armour available to the armies of the Great war, these terrifying weapons are much in demand. A downside is their
> enormous weight and terrifying recoil, and thus they are most often used by Communicants or Anointed who possess the
> supernatural strength to wield such weapons.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers     | Keywords        |
|:---------|:------|:--------------|:----------------|
| 2-handed | 36”   | +1D to Injury | HEAVY, CRITICAL |

**Rules:** Ignores armour. Add +1 DICE when rolling on the Injury Chart.

### Machine Gun

> Machine Guns are lethal fully-automatic firearms, capable of mowing down entire ranks of infantry from afar. The
> firing rate depends on the lock assembly used but averages 500 rounds per minute.

| Type     | Range | Modifiers | Keywords |
|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|
| 2-handed | 36”   | 3 Attacks | HEAVY    |

**Rules:** Machine Guns can make three Attack Actions instead of one. They can target separate models with each attack,
as long as all targets are within 6” of each other. After taking all three attacks the Activation of the model is over
regardless of any remaining ACTIONS the model might have.

### Flamethrower

> A flamethrower is a terrifying weapon capable of projecting great streams of fire and flammable liquids at a distance.
> It is ideal for clearing bunkers, trenches and other fortifications, killing in a most horrific way. Consequently, it is
> greatly favoured by the Heretic forces.

| Type     | Range    | Modifiers              | Keywords    |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------------|:------------|
| 2-handed | Template | Ignores Cover & Armour | FIRE, HEAVY |

**Rules:** This weapon uses a teardrop-shaped template. All models under the template are hit. It ignores all penalties
for cover and all armour saves. Due to the FIRE keyword, it causes an additional Blood Marker on a hit.

---

## **Grenades**

### Grenades

> Grenades or hand bombs are a staple of trench warfare. Grenades can kill the enemy underground or behind cover. They
> can also force the enemy into the open, providing targets for rifle and machine gun fire.

| Type    | Range | Modifiers | Keywords                    |
|:--------|:------|:----------|:----------------------------|
| GRENADE | 8”    | -         | ASSAULT, SHRAPNEL, BLAST 2” |

**Rules:** Grenades have BLAST 2” – all models within 2” of a model are hit but models other than the original target
roll Injuries with -1 DICE.

### Incendiary Grenades

> Incendiary grenades can set their target alight with sulphur, phosphorous or flammable gas captured from the Lake of
> Fire in the 7th Circle of Hell.

| Type    | Range | Modifiers | Keywords      |
|:--------|:------|:----------|:--------------|
| GRENADE | 8”    | -         | ASSAULT, FIRE |

**Rules:** Incendiary Grenades cause +1 BLOOD MARKER upon a hit due their FIRE Keyword. The incendiary grenades ignore
armour on a Critical Hit (12+ to hit).

### Gas Grenades

> Gas Grenades are insidious weapons, attacking the lungs and other internal organs with noxious fumes. Devil Alchemists
> of the 5th Circle are especially clever in creating these fiendish and hated weapons.

| Type    | Range | Modifiers  | Keywords               |
|:--------|:------|:-----------|:-----------------------|
| GRENADE | 8”    | -1D Injury | ASSAULT, GAS, BLAST 3” |

**Rules:** Gas Grenades ignore all penalties for cover and armour but roll injuries with -1 DICE. They have BLAST 3” –
they hit all models within 3” of a target they hit.

### Satchel Charge

> Battlefield explosives designed to break apart enemy fortifications and to crack even the toughest of armour.

| Type    | Range | Modifiers                  | Keywords                    |
|:--------|:------|:---------------------------|:----------------------------|
| GRENADE | 6”    | +1D Injury, ignores armour | HEAVY, BLAST 3”, CONSUMABLE |

**Rules:** You can aim the Satchel Charge at either a 1mm x 1mm point on the ground or an enemy model within range.
Next, take a Ranged Attack ACTION. If the roll fails (i.e. you roll 6 or less), the bomb lands 1” away from its intended
location, multiplied by the number representing the degree of failure (for example, if you rolled 5, the bombard shot
lands 2” away, as 7-5=2). The direction is decided by your opponent. A Satchel Charge adds +1 DICE to injury rolls.
Additionally, if the Satchel Charge lands directly on top of a model, it ignores that model’s armour.

### Molotov Cocktail

> Developed on the desperate Finnish battle frontier against Ice Demons, this improvised weapon consists of a glass
> bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture plus a source of ignition.

| Type    | Range | Modifiers     | Keywords      |
|:--------|:------|:--------------|:--------------|
| GRENADE | 6”    | -1D to Injury | FIRE, ASSAULT |

**Rules:** -1 DICE on injury rolls. Molotov Cocktails ignore all penalties for terrain/cover, as well as ignoring all
armour on a Critical Attack roll.

## **Armour & Equipment**

A model can wear only one suit of armour at a time. Shields can be combined with any Armour unless otherwise indicated.

### Trench Shield

> Shields used in trench warfare are made of steel reinforced with Orichalcum to allow them to withstand even
> high-calibre bullets, or from metal mined from Infernal bedrock and shaped in the armouries of Pandæmonium, the Capital
> of Hell.
**Rules:** Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat, and cannot be switched out. Grants -1 to all
> injury rolls against the model. This bonus stacks with any armour the model wears, unless otherwise indicated. For the
> purposes of wielding a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Trench Shield does not take a hand to
> wield but still functions as normal.

### Heavy Ballistic Shield

> These massive shields are made of aramid fibre mesh and orichalcum-steel alloy. They are so heavy that they can only
> be carried by Heavy Mechanized infantry, and even then they are too cumbersome to be used in fast paced melee. They are
> mainly used for protection during their ponderous advance towards the enemy.
**Rules:** Always takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat and cannot be switched out. The target is
> always considered to be in Cover when shot, and counts as fighting behind a defended obstacle when an enemy charges
> them. These bonuses cannot be combined with Polearms, shovels, cover or defended obstacles. For the purposes of wielding
> a 2-handed weapon with the ‘Shield Combo’ indicator, the Heavy Ballistic Shield does not take a hand to wield but still
> functions as normal.

### Standard Armour

> With the advancements in metallurgy and technology, both Faithful and Heretic armies are well-equipped with suits of
> alloy armour that can withstand an impact from a bullet or turn aside the sharpest of blades. Standard armour is usually
> mass-produced, but highly effective even against high-calibre weapons.
**Rules:** -1 to all Injury Chart rolls against the model. Can be combined with any shield.

### Reinforced Armour

> Reinforced armour is a master-crafted suit made individually for the most important and elite troops. Each one is
> richly decorated and often carries the personal device of the warrior who wears it.
**Rules:** Grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour.

### Machine Armour

> Combining the rarest of divine metal alloys and the latest technology of New Antioch, Machine Armour makes its wearer
> a virtual mobile tank.
**Rules:** Grants a -3 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing this armour, and treats Down Injury
> results as a Minor Hit instead (note that the TOUGH Keyword ability to avoid Out of Action with Down overrides this).
> Due to its bulk the wearer rolls D3 for a charge extra distance instead of D6. Machine armour cannot be combined with
> any shield. Models wearing Machine Armour may have a base size of 40mm if you wish, unless the model wearing it is
> already on 50mm or bigger base. If worn by a model that is not part of a New Antioch force/subfaction, the only bonus
> the armour gives is the -3 injury modifier, as the chemical treatment that allows the wearer to withstand the rigors of
> the armour is a carefully guarded military secret. D3 charge distance remains in force.

### Holy Icon Shield

> These shields are made from icons that have performed miracles. Mounted on blessed wood, they are harder than any
> steel and virtually indestructible. Only the most revered fighters in the service of the Church ever carry one.
**Rules:** Takes one hand to use in both melee and in ranged combat. Grants -1 to all injury rolls against the model.
> This shield is effective even against weapons and attacks that would normally ignore armour.

### Holy Icon Armour

> Only a few of these suits of armour exist in all of Christendom. Covered with miraculous icons this suit of armour is
> impervious to most worldly weapons.
**Rules:** Grants a -2 modifier to all injury rolls against the model wearing it. The armour works even against attacks
> that would normally ignore armour. A Critical Hit is required to penetrate it.
