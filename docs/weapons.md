Unless otherwise stated in the rules, each warrior in your
warband has the following options for Ranged weapons:
; One two-handed ranged weapon OR
; Up to two one-handed ranged weapons.
They also have the following options for Melee weapons:
; One two-handed melee weapon OR
; Up to two one-handed melee weapons.
All weapon entries clearly indicate if you need one or
two hands to effectively use the given weapon. Unless
clearly stated in the Range characteristic, a ranged
weapon cannot be used in melee combat. Unless they
can be used in melee, ranged weapons do not use either
hand in melee (leaving both hands free for melee
weapons). They always count as ranged weapons for the
purposes of determining how many ranged or melee
weapons a model can carry.
; Each model can wear a single suit of armour and
wear one type of headgear.
; Each model can carry one type of grenade.
; A model can have any number of Equipment
items, but only one of each type per model.
The following pieces of Equipment or Armour can be
carried by models as indicated in the rules. They take up
one of the hands of the model at all times, thus limiting
which weapons they may use in combat:
; One shield (most commonly a trench shield)
which always takes one hand to use in both melee
and ranged combat and cannot be switched out.
; One standard/banner/flag which always takes
one hand to use in both melee and ranged combat
and cannot be switched out.
; One musical instrument which always takes one
hand to use in both melee and ranged combat and
cannot be switched out.
Ranged Weapons
The weapons on the following pages can be used to
perform a Ranged Attack Action. Use the Action
Success Chart to see if the attack hits as explained in
the Combat Rules. Add the number of +/- DICE as
indicated by the ranged characteristics entry for the
model in the relevant Warband Armoury.
Note: Ranged weapons cannot be used in melee unless
specifically noted by having Range marked as “Melee”.
