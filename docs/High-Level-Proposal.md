Of course. This sounds like an exciting project! I've analyzed the `Rules-v163.md` file and your project's tech stack. Building a campaign tracker for a narrative skirmish game like Trench Crusade is a perfect use case for a Laravel and Vue application.

Here is a high-level proposal for the application's design and data systems.

### High-Level Proposal: Trench Crusade Campaign Tracker

The primary goal is to create a robust, modular, and user-friendly web application for players to manage their Trench Crusade warbands through a campaign. The system will handle everything from initial warband creation to tracking the progress, injuries, and accolades of individual soldiers from battle to battle.

#### **1. Core Data Systems (Database Schema)**

At the heart of the application will be a relational database. Given the nature of the game's rules—with units, weapons, abilities, and keywords all interconnecting—a well-structured schema is essential.

Here are the core database tables I would propose:

*   **`users`**: Standard table for user authentication and ownership of warbands.
*   **`factions`**: A simple table to hold the different factions (e.g., The Church, Heretic Legions). This allows for easy expansion as new factions are released.
*   **`warbands`**: The central point for a user. It would belong to a `user` and a `faction` and have a name, notes, and perhaps a calculated "Warband Rating" based on the units inside it.
*   **`base_units`**: This table will act as a "template" for every type of soldier available in the game. It will store the default stats (Movement, Melee, etc.), keywords, and starting equipment options for a "Trench Pilgrim" or a "Demonic Stalker," for example. This makes adding new unit types in the future a simple database entry.
*   **`units`**: This table will represent a player's *specific* soldier. When a user adds a unit to their warband, we'll create an entry here, copying the base stats from the `base_units` table. This record will have its own `name`, `current_experience`, `rank`, `injuries`, and any promotions. It will belong to a `warband`.
*   **`items` (Weapons, Armour, Equipment)**: A table to store all the gear available in the game, including its rules, cost, and any associated `Keywords` (like `HEAVY` or `ASSAULT`).
*   **`abilities`**: A table to store all special abilities or skills a unit can gain through experience.
*   **`keywords`**: A table listing all the game's keywords (`HEAVY`, `FEARLESS`, etc.) and their descriptions.
*   **Pivot Tables**: To connect everything, we'll use several many-to-many relationship tables:
    *   `unit_items`: Links a specific `unit` to its equipped `items`.
    *   `unit_abilities`: Links a specific `unit` to the `abilities` it has learned.
    *   `keywordables`: A polymorphic table to link `keywords` to `base_units`, `items`, and `abilities`, providing a flexible way to manage rules.

#### **2. Data Flow & Application Logic**

The application flow would be centered around the user managing their warband's state between games.

1.  **Warband Creation**: A user signs up, creates a new `Warband`, and selects a `Faction`.
2.  **Roster Building**: The user is presented with a list of `base_units` available to their chosen faction. They add units to their roster, which creates new entries in their `units` table. They can then customize each unit's wargear by attaching records from the `items` table.
3.  **Frontend Display (Vue & Inertia)**: A Laravel controller fetches all the data for a warband—the warband itself, its units, and their associated equipment and abilities. Inertia.js then passes this entire data structure as a "prop" directly to your main Vue component, e.g., `WarbandRoster.vue`.
4.  **Post-Game Sequence**: This is the core campaign loop. After a battle, the user will go through a guided process on the website:
    *   Update each unit's experience points.
    *   Roll for and record any injuries or casualties.
    *   "Level up" units that have enough experience, which may involve increasing a stat, or adding a new record to the `unit_abilities` table.
    *   Manage the warband's treasury and purchase new `items` or `units`.
5.  **Modularity**: Because we've separated the "base templates" from the user's "specific instances", the system is highly modular. When a new expansion for Trench Crusade is released with new units or weapons, you would simply need to add them to the `base_units` and `items` tables using a database seeder. The core application logic would not need to change.

This design provides a solid and scalable foundation. It correctly models the relationships in the game rules and uses the tech stack efficiently, with Laravel managing the data and business logic, and Vue.js (supercharged by Inertia) creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.

To ensure we start by building the most useful part of this system first, I have a question for you.

This is a great project! The rules you've provided are a playtest version and mention that campaign rules are still in development. To start, what would be the most valuable feature for you in the first version of this app? Should we prioritize building a comprehensive **'Warband Roster'** where you can see all your units, their stats, and equipment, or should we focus first on the **'Post-Battle Sequence'** for tracking experience, injuries, and level-ups for your units?
